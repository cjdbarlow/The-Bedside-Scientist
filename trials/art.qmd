	* ~1000 adults with moderate-severe ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation, without high risk of barotrauma or escalating vasoactive requirements
	* Multicentre (120!), unblinded, allocation concealed, block randomised trial
	* Open lung vs. control
		* Open lung
			* PCV with driving pressure of 15cmH~2~O
			* Muscle relaxation applied
			* Staircase recruitment up to PEEP of 45cmH~2~O
			* PEEP down-titrated in 3cmH~2~O increments, with measurement of static compliance at leach level\
			Level with highest lung compliance noted.
			* Further recruitment at PEEP 45cmH~2~O of PEEP
			* New PEEP set to level at maximal compliance + 2cmH~2~O
		* Control
			* Conventional ARDSnet ventilation
		* Both groups managed with VCV at 6mL/kg with safe lung ventilation
		* Refractory hypoxaemia managed with proning, iNO, or VV ECMO
		* Pressure support attempted once PEEP <14cmH~2~O
	* ↑ Mortality in open lung group (55.3% vs 49.3%, p=0.04)
	* Secondary outcomes showed the open lung group had ↑ 6 month mortality, ↓ ventilator free days, and more pneumothoraces requiring drainage
	* Compliance in open lung group did not significantly ↑ following recruitment
	* Recruitment manoeuvre had to be abandoned in 15% due to hypotension or hypoxia
	* Most patients only had one recruitment manoeuvre
	* Indiscriminate aggressive recruitment manoeuvres are harmful in moderate-severe ARDS, but this does not rule out benefit in select subgroups
