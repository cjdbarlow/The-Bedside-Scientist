	* Intubated patients where, on day 4, the treating clinician believes they will need ⩾7 further days of mechanical ventilation and a tracheostomy is not otherwise indicated or contraindicated
	* Multicentre, randomised trial
	* 80% power for 8.3% ARR ↓ in 30 day mortality (!!), assuming baseline of 31.5%\
	Multiple readjustments due to changing baseline mortality and recruitment fatigue.
	* Early (day 4) vs. Late (⩾10 day) tracheostomy
		* Early
			* 85% received tracheostomy
			* 7% never received tracheostomy
			* 7.5% received late tracheostomy
		* Late
			* 40% received tracheostomy after day 10 of admission
			* 53% did not receive a tracheostomy as it was no longer indicated
			* 7% received tracheostomy before day 10
	* No change in 30 day mortality (30.8% vs. 31.5%)
	* No difference in secondary outcomes, including ICU length of stay or ventilated days
	* Overall: We are not successful at predicting need for tracheostomy, there are not insignificant procedural risks, and early tracheostomy does not appear to have benefits in accelerating ventilator weaning
