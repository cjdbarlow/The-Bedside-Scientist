	* ~620 Frenchpersons with KDIGO stage 3 injury, ventilated or on catecholamine infusions, without a hard indication for dialysis
	* Multicentre (31), block-randomised, unblinded trial
	* 546 patients gives 90% power to detect 15% (!!) â†“ ARR in death from baseline mortality  of 55%
	* Early vs. delayed RRT
		* Early
			* RRT within 6 hours
			* 98% received RRT
		* Control
			* RRT if profound metabolic abnormalities, APO, or 72 hours of oligo/anuria
			* 51% received RRT
	* No change in 60 day mortality (48.5% vs 49.7%)
	* Double CLABSI in the early RRT group (10% vs. 5%)
	* Post-hoc analyses:
		* Lowest mortality in those who never received RRT
		* Highest mortality in those who received RRT late
