	* 230 German with KDIGO 2 AKI despite resuscitation and some marker of severity
	* Single-centre, block randomised RCT
	* Early (<8 hours of KDIGO 2) vs. delayed (<12 hours of KDIGO 3, or an absolute indication for) RRT
		* Early RRT\
		All patients received RRT, median in 6 hours.
		* Delayed RRT\
		91% received RRT, median in 25 hours.
		* All received CVVHDF
	* â†“ Mortality with early RRT (39.3% vs. 55%)
	* 47% cardiac surgical population
	* Only 9% not dialysed in the delayed group, so low risk of inappropriate CRRT wtih early filtration
