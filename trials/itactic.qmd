	* 392 adult Europeans with trauma requiring MTP activation and active bleeding within 1 hour of ED admission and 3 hours of injury
	* Block randomised multicentre (7), clinician unblinded, researcher blinded RCT
	* 392 patients provides 80% for 15% ↓ in death or massive transfusion at 24 hours 
	* Viscoelastic assays (ROTEM or TEG) vs. conventional coagulation testing
		* Protocolised treatment of coagulation abnormalities for both groups
		* All patients received 1:1:1 transfusion, with algorithmic administration of TXA, fibrinogen, and additiojnal products
	* Most patients severely injured
	* No difference in primary outcome (67% vs 64%)\
	Ambitious difference for a monitoring trial.
	* Secondary outcome supports 28 day mortality ↓ in TBI group
