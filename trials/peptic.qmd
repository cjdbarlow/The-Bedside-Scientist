* [PEPTIC](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2759412) (2020)
	* 26,777 adults requiring ICU admission and invasive ventilation
	* Unblinded multi-centre cluster randomised crossover trial\
	Units used one class of drug for 6 months, then swapped to the other.
	* Powered to detect 2% ARR
	* PPI vs. histamine-2 receptor blocker
		* PPI group\
		5% received H2RB.
		* H2RB group\
		20% received PPI.
		* Indication for stress ulcer prophylaxis at clinician discretion
		* Average duration 2.7 days
	* *No* difference in 90 day mortality (18.3% vs 17.5%, 95% CI 1.00 – 1.10))\
	Results have been controversial, interpretations include:
		* Use H2RBs as signal towards death is stronger than risk of non-fatal UGIB
		* Significant cross-over and cluster design limit interpretability of weak results
		* 2.7 days of PPI seems *en face* unlikely to be fatal
	* Secondary outcomes:
		* ↓ UGIB in PPI group (1.3% vs 1.8%, RR 0.73 (0.57-0.92))
		* ↑ Mortality in cardiac subgroup
		* No change in *C. difficile* infections
