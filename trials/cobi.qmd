	* 370 French adults with moderate or severe TBI with radiological cranial abnormality, without cervical spine injury or at imminent risk of death, admitted to one of 9 ICUs
	* 80% power to detect 20% RRR in poor neurological outcome (GOS-E 1-5) at 3 and 6 months
	* Intervention arm were generally sicker, with ↑ diffuse brain injury (Marshall III/IV 17% vs 12%) as well as evacuable mass lesions (intervention on 32% vs 22%)
	* Continuous infusion of 20% saline vs. usual care
		* Hypertonic saline group
			* Adjusted to prevent sodium >155mmol/L
			* Continued for >48 hours
			* Ceased when all other ICP therapies ceased for >12 hours
			* Normalisation of serum sodium managed
		* Usual care
			* As per BTF guidelines
			* Osmolar therapy permitted as rescue therapy
		* No significant difference in favourable outcome (GOS-E 6-8; 32.6% vs 35.4%)
		* No difference in intracranial hypertension, ICU length of stay, or adverse events
		* ↑ Hypernatraemia in the intervention group
