	* 554 German and Danish patients aged >30 following OOHCA
	* Without obvious cardiac cause (STE or LBBB), or obvious non-cardiac cause (TBI)
	* Investigator-initiated, open label, block-randomised RCT
	* Immediate vs. delayed angiography
		* Immediate angiography
		* Delayed angiography
			* Angiogram >24 hours if high likelihood of coronary cause
			* Immediate angiography if obvious cardiac cause
		* All clinical relevant lesions had revascularisation attempted
	* No change in 30 day mortality (54% vs 46%, CI -0.6-16.4%)
	* Powered for 12% ARR mortality difference, seems ambitious
	* 17% of delayed group had angiogram <24 hours
