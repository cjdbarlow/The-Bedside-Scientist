	* 412 Britons in 51 NHS ICUs with invasive ventilation for early (<48 hours) moderate-severe (P/F <150) hypoxic respiratory failure
		* Without a PE, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax
		* With a CO~2~ production that prevented ↓ V~T~ <3mL/kg
		* Without contraindications to anticoagulation
	* 1120 patients gives 90% power to detect 9% ARR of death\
	Stopped early by DSMB on basis of conditional power analysis and not safety concerns, although there are some safety concerns!
	* Open-label randomisation to ECOR vs. usual care
		* ECOR group
			* 2-7 days of ECOR
			* Dual-lumen percutaneous catheter
			* Maximal flow (350-450mL/min) with sweep of 10L/min
			* V~T~ of 3mL/kg
			* Weaning of ECOR by protocol
		* Usual care\
		Protocolised mechanical ventilation as per ARDSnet tables.
	* No difference in primary outcome of 90 day mortality (41.5 vs 39.5%), or secondary outcomes of V~T~ or ventilator free days
	* Intervention associated with ↑ adverse events, including ICH\
	5 felt to be ECOR related, 3 deaths. 
	* Low patient numbers in most sites (4/51 had >10 patients)
