	* 392 adult Danes with IHCA requiring adrenaline, without invasive circulatory support, in 10 hospitals
	* Investigator-initiated, blinded, placebo-controlled, block-randomised by site
	* Consent from patients or surrogates, if survived
	* Randomised to 40mg methylprednisolone and 20 units vasopressin vs. placebo
		* Intervention group:
			* Received cocktail as soon as possible after first adrenaline dose
			* Further 20 unit vasopressin boluses could be given after each adrenaline dose
		* Placebo group:
			* Received otherwise usual care
			* Notably significantly higher use of VA ECMO (30% vs 14%)
	* Intervention group demonstrated significant â†‘ in ROSC (42% vs 33%, CI 1.03-1.63)
	* No difference in secondary outcomes of 30/90 day survival or neurological outcome
	* No difference in TTM, angiography, or glucocorticoid use
