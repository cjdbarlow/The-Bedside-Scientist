	* 420 New York cardiac surgical patients with a virgin sternum undergoing CABG, AV, or aortic surgery; without history of AF, arrhythmias, or left pleural disease
	* Randomised, unblinded, mostly one surgeon
	* Posterior left pericardiotomy vs. no intervention
		* Pericardiotomy anticipated to drain pericardial space into left pleural space, ↓ effusion accumulation and arrhythmogenicity
	* Significantly ↓ in intervention group:
		* AF (17% vs. 32%)\
		Independent of pre-operative β-blocker use.
		* Anticoagulation (6% vs 14%)
		* Pericardial effusion (12% vs 21%)
	* No change in stroke or MI rate
