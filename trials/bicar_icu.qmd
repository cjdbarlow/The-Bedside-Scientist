	* 389 adult Frenchpersons with metabolic acidosis (pH <7.2) and lactataemia or OSFA >4 
	* Multicentre (26), unblinded, allocation concealed, randomised trial
	* 80% power for 15% ARR ↓ (!) in composite of death or organ failure from 45% control group mortality
	* Bicarbonate vs. control
		* Bicarbonate
			* 4.2% bicarbonate targeting pH >7.3, up to 1L/24 hours
		* Control\
		No placebo.
	* No difference in primary outcome (66% vs. 71%) overall, though difference in defined subgroup of patients with AKI\
	Note unpowered for this.
	* Secondary outcomes demonstrated ↓ RRT in bicarbonate group (35% vs. 52%)
	* 24% of the control group received bicarbonate, and >100 patients were excluded because they had already been given bicarbonate
	* No differential between source of acidosis (excluding AKI, which presumably had a uraemic contibution)
