	* 104 mechanically ventilated adults, with clinical equipoise to oxygenation target
	* Multicentre (4), parallel group, RCT
	* SpO~2~ 88-92% vs. â‰¥96% SpO~2~
		* FiO~2~ titrated by bedside nurse, PEEP by patient
	* Primary outcome of mean AUC for oxygenation metrics
	* 14% time-off-target in conservative arm vs. 3% in liberal arm
	* Established general feasibility of oxygenation target trials
