	* ~1500 non-pregnant, non-burned Europeans with sepsis within 12 hours of diagnosis
	* Restrictive vs. liberal fluid strategy
		* Restrictive: Crystalloid given for severe hypoperfusion, overt losses, or to ensure at least 1L/24 hours
		* Liberal: Crystalloid given based on surviving sepsis guidelines, to replace losses
	* Vasopressors as per trial protocol
	* No difference in mortality
	* Small difference in volume administered (~2L at day 5)
