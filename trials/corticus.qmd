	* 488 adults with severe sepsis
	* Multicentre (52), double-blinded, block randomised trial
	* Hydrocortisone vs. placebo
		* Hydrocortisone
			* Hydrocortisone 50mg IV Q6H for 5 days
			* Tapered over 6 days
		* Placebo
	* Underpowered due to lower-than-expected control group mortality
	* Slow recruitment despite large number of sites, suggests selection bias
	* No difference in 28 day mortality (39.2% vs 36.1%)
	* Secondary outcomes insignificant except faster shock reversal (3.8 vs. 5.8 days) in hydrocortisone group
