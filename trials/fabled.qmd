	* Adults in the ED with *suspected* severe sepsis
	* Multi-centre (7) diagnostic cohort study
	* 2 sets of blood cultures taken before antibiotics via separate venepuncture
	* 1-2 sets of cultures taken 30-240 minutes after antibiotics
	* Significant ↓ in positive cultures post antibiotics
		* ~30% positive pre-antibiotic, compared to ~20% positive post-antibiotic\
		RRR ~33%.
		* More pronounced ↓ in positive post-antibiotic cultures if organism was sensitive to antibiotic used\
		RRR ~50%.
		* Positive post-antibiotic cultures were associated with ↑ time to positivity, suggesting ↑ bacterial burden
