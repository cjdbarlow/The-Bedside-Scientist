	* 510 adults with severe TBI within 3 hours of injury, without cardiac arrest, shock, or suggestion of brain death
	* 82% power to detect 15% absolute risk ↑ in favourable neurological outcome (GOS-E 5-8)
	* Multicentre, international, assessor blinded, block randomised trial
	* Therapeutic hypothermia vs. normothermia
		* Hypothermia
			* 4°C saline infusion until 35°C
			* Surface cooling used to achieve 33°C
			* Maintained for 3-7 days
			* Rewarming individualised to ICPO
		* Normothermia
			* Targeting 36.5-37.5°C
	* No difference in primary outcome (48.8% vs 49.1%)
	* ↑ Pneumonia and bradycardia in hypothermia group
