* [RESCUE ICP](http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa1605215) (2016)
	* 408 patients aged 10-65 with TBI, abnormal CT, and ICP >25mmHg for 1-12 hours, despite tier 1 and 2 therapies
	* Multicentre (52), international, parallel group, block mutated RCT, statified by site
	* 400 patients gave 80% for 15% difference in favourable neurological outcome
	* Decompressive craniectomy vs. standard care
		* Decompressive craniectomy
			* Large unilateral frontotemporoparietal craniectomy for unilateral swelling
			* Bifrontal craniectomy for diffuse swelling
		* Medical care
			* Barbiturates
			* Crossover to craniectomy permitted if decline, which occurred in 37% of patients
		* Standard ICP control measures in both groups
	* Decompressive craniectomy resulted in â†‘ survival with a bad neurological outcome
	* Slow recruitment
	* High crossover from medical group
	* Investigators estimated for every 100 patients receiving decompressive craniectomy there were:
		* 22 survivors
			* 6 vegetative
			* 8 lower-severe disability
			* 8 upper-severe disability
