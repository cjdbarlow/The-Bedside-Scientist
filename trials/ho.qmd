	* 240 non-pregnant Australian trauma patients with ISS >15 and a contraindication to chemoprophylaxis, without confirmed PE or systemic anticoagulation
	* Block randomised multicentre (4) trial
	* 80% power for 8.5% ↓ in symptomatic PE, for control group PE rate of 9%\
	This is a 94% RRR, which is ambitious.
	* IVC filter vs. standard care
		* IVC filter
			* 89% within 24 hours
			* Removed once chemoprophylaxis established
			* Filter type at radiology discretion
		* Standard care
			* IVC filter permitted if well established indication
	* IPCC to uninjured legs
	* Routine DVT ultrasound
	* No significant difference in symptomatic PE or death (13.9% vs 14.4%)
	* Secondary outcomes:
		* Significant ↓ (0% vs 14.7%) in symptomatic PE in patients who did start chemoprophylaxis within 7 days of injury
	* Single centre provided almost all patients
