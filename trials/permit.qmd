	* 894 adult ICU patients receiving EN within 48 hours, with an expected ICU LoS >72 hours
	* Multi-centre (7), block randomised, unblinded RCT
	* 80% power for 8% absolute reduction (!!) in mortality from baseline of 25%
	* Permissive underfeeding vs. standard feeding
		* Underfeeding
			* Caloric goal 40-60% of requirement
			* Protein and fluid supplementation as required
			* Average intake was 835 ±297 kCal/day (46 ±14% of goal)
		* Standard feeding
			* Goal was 70-100% of requirement
			* Average intake was 1299 ±467 kCal/day (71 ±22% of goal)
		* Caloric goal by equations
		* Protein goal 1.2-1.5g/kg/day
		* Over or underfeeding was corrected by adjusting the next days feed target
	* No difference in 90-day mortality (27.2% vs. 28.9%)
	* No difference in any secondary outcome or electrolytes
	* Higher insulin requirement and BSL in feeding group
