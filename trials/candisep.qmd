	* 342 Adults with sepsis at risk of invasive candidiasis, but without proven fungal infection and not on fungal treatment
	* Blood cultures performed and randomised to:
		* (1→3)-β-D-Glucan testing performed on blood cultures\
		Fungal cell wall component that can be detected prior to cultures becoming positive.
		* Standard cultures
	* β-D-Glucan group received more (57% vs 27%) and earlier (1.1 vs 4.4 days) antifungal treatment without a change in mortality
	* Lower power than anticipated due to lower mortality
	* Lower rates of invasive candidiasis than anticipated
