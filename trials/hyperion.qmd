* [HYPERION](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1906661) (2019)
	* 584 non-pregnant, non-lactating Frenchpersons without end-stage liver disease post IHCA or OOHCA with a non-shockable rhythm *of any cause* with GCS <8 prior to admission, with <10 minute no-flow time and <60 minute low-flow time, not on obscene doses of vasopressors (<1ug/kg/min of nor/adrenaline)
	* Randomised, single assessor, assessor-blinded, multi-centre RCT
	* 80% power for 9% ↑ in survival with favourable neurological outcome, assuming 14% in control group
	* Hypothermia (33°C) vs normothermia (36.5-37.5°C)
		* Hypothermia
			* Maintained for *24 hours*
			* External or internal active devices used
			* Rewarmed at 0.25-0.5°C/hr
			* Sedation to RASS -5
		* Normothermia
			* Maintained for *48 hours*
			* External or internal active devices used
			* Sedation to RASS 0
		* Routine sedation only for first 12 hours
	* ↑ Survival with favourable outcome in hypothermia group (10.2% vs. 5.7%)\
	Fragile result, particularly with subjective outcome.
	* 30% had no bystander CPR
	* 4-9% were unwitnessed arrests (lower in hypothermia group)
	* 5% of control group had fevers
	* Greater overlap of temperatures compared to TTM
