	* 192 Canadians with admitted to a single cardiac ICU in Ottawa with cardiogenic shock
	* Powered to detect 20% difference in an absolutely mammoth composite primary outcome\
	Death, cardiac arrest, mechanical support, transplant, non-fatal MI, CVA, CRRT.
	* Single cardiac ICU
	* Randomised with stratification based on LV, RV, or biventricular failure
	* Milrinone vs. dobutamine
		* Milrinone escalated in stages from 0.125-0.5μg/kg/min
		* Dobutamine escalated in stages from 2.5-10μg/kg/min
	* No significant difference in the composite outcome
	* Similar arrhythmia and hypotension rates
	* 17-24 hours between admission and randomisation may mask effects of treatment during this critical interval
