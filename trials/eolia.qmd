	* 249 non-pregnant Europeans with ARDS with severe hypoxia despite adjunctive therapies and no ECMO contraindications\
	Severe hypoxia including
		* P/F <50mmHg for 3 hours
		* P/F <80mmHg for 6 hours
		* pH <7.25 with PaC~2~ >60mmHg for >6 hours with lung protective ventilation
	* Prospective, multicenter, industry-supported RCT
	* 331 patients powers for 20% ARR in ECMO group, assuming 60% control mortality
	* VV ECMO vs. standard care
		* ECMO group
			* Percutaneous femoral/jugular configuration
			* FiO~2~ and pump flow adjusted for SpO~2~ >90%
			* Sweep adjusted for PaCO~2~ <45mmHg
		* Stawndard care
			* Lung protective ventilation
			* Encouraged:
				* NMBA
				* Proning
				* Recruitment
			* Inhaled pulmonary vasodilators permitted if above ineffective
			* Crossover to VV ECMO if SpO~2~ <80% despite the above
	* Stopped early for futility
	* No difference in mortality at day 60 (35% vs. 46%, RR 0.76 (CI 0.55-1.04)))
	* Secondary outcomes showed the ECMO group had:
		* ↓ "Treatment failure" (RR 0.62, CI 0.47-0.82)\
		Death or crossover to ECMO.
		* ↓ RRT 
		* ↑ Thrombocytopenia
		* ↑ Bleeding
	* Slow (6 years) recruitment
