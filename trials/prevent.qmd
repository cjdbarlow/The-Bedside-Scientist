	* 2,000 ICU patients with no contraindication to chemoprophylaxis
	* International, multi-centre RCT
	* 80% power to detect 3% absolute â†“ in proximal DVT, assuming 7% control group incidence
	* * Intermittent pneumatic compressors. vs standard care
		* IPCC
			* Sequential compression used for >18 hours/day
		* Standard care
			* IPCC used only if chemoprophylaxis was interrupted
	* No change in proximal DVT (3.9% vs 4.2%)
	* No change in PE, DVT/PE, or mortality
	* IPCC offer no additional benefit over chemoprophylaxis alone
