	* ~3000 adults with severe AKI without immediate need for dialysis
	* Open-label, assessor-blinded RCT
	* 90% power for 6% ↓ 90 day mortality, assuming 40% mortality in control group
	* Accelerated vs. standard RRT
		* Accelerated received RRT within 12 hours (mean 6)
		* Standard received RRT unless necessary
		* Modality and anticoagulation were at clinician preference
	* No difference in mortality
	* ↑ In RRT dependence at 90 days (10% vs 6%) in accelerated RRT group
