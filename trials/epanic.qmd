	* 4640 nutritionally at-risk non-pregnant Belgian adults admitted to ICU, without profound malnutrition, ketosis, HHS, or moribund
	* Multicentre (7), unblinded, allocation-concealed, stratified (16 disease categories) trial
	* 80% power for 1 day change in ICU length of stay
	* Late PN vs. early PN
		* Late PN
			* PN at day 8 if EN not sufficient to meet caloric goal
			* Mean length of stay 3 days (IQR 2-7)
		* Early PN
			* PN at day 3 to meet 100% of goal
			* Mean length of stay 4 days (IQR 2-9)
		* Dextrose for caloric targeting
		* Tight glycaemic control (4.4-6.1mmol/L)
		* EN at day 2 if PO diet could not be initiated
		* 25-30kCal/kg/day, based on IBW
	* Significant ↓ ICU length of stay in late group (3 vs. 4, p = 0.02)
	* No change in mortality
	* Secondary outcomes all favoured late group:
		* ↓ New infection rate
		* ↓ Duration of mechanical ventilation and RRT
	* Very short duration of ICU admission in both groups
