	* 1861 non-pregnant patients across 14 countries with witnessed OOHCA with sustained ROSC and FOUR score <4 without: ECMO, treatment limitations, ICH
	* International, multi-centre, parallel group RCT
	* Randomised to hypothermia (33°C) vs. normothermia (36°C)
		* Hypothermia group
			* Rapidly cooled with cold IVT and active internal or external cooling
			* Rewarming commenced after 28 hours at <0.3°C/hr
		* Normothermia group
			* Cooled to ⩽37.5°C
			* Less-invasive therapies initiated first
		* Both groups had temperature managed using a feedback-controlled system
	* Median temperature in hypothermia group at 3 hours was 34°C, reflecting degree of difficulty achieving hypothermia
	* No difference in 180 day mortality (50% vs 48%)
	* ↑ Arrhythmias in hypothermia group (24% vs. 16%)
	* Definitive trial on this question
