	* ~4600 at-risk CABG patients
	* Multicentre (22) block randomised RCT, stratified by site and on-pump vs. off-pump surgery
	* 90% power for 3% ARR from a 10% composite of death and thrombotic events (MI, CVA< PE, AKI, bowel infarction)
	* 2-by-2 factorial design
		* Aspirin vs. placebo
			* Aspirin 100mg 1-2 hours pre-surgery
			* Aspirin armed discontinued eraly due to higher-than-expected even rate
		* TXA vs. placebo
			* TXA initially 100mg/kg 30 minutes post-induction, ↓ to 50mg/kg partway due to seizure concern
	* No change in primary outcome for TXA (16.7% vs. 18.1%) or aspirin (19.3% vs. 20.4%)
	* Significantly ↓ return to theatre (1.4% vs 2.8%) and blood product use with TXA
	* No significant change in return to theatre or blood product use with aspirin
	* ↑ Seizures in TXA group (0.75% vs. 0.1%)
