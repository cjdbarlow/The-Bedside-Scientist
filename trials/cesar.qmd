	* Britons aged 18-65 with potentially reversible severe respiratory failure without contraindications to heparin
		* Multi-centre (92 tertiary, 11 conventional, 1 ECMO, assessor-blinded RCT
		* 80% power to detect 18% ↓ ARR in death or severe disability from control group of 73%
	* Transfer to ECMO centre vs. conventional ventilation
		* Transfer ECMO centre
			* Standardised low-volume, low-pressure ventilation in majority
			* If no response to ventilation in 12 hours, then VV ECMO initiated (68/85)
				* Percutaneous cannulation
				* Roller pumps
				* PMP oxygenators
		* Conventional ventilation
			* Unprotocolised PCV or HFOV
	* Significant ↑ in survival without severe disability in ECMO group (63% vs. 47%, RR 0.69 (CI 0.05 - 0.97))
	* Secondary outcomes: ECMO group had significantly:
		* ↓ Proning (36%. vs 42%)
		* ↑ Steroids (84% vs. 64%)
		* ↑ MARS (17% vs. 0%)
		* ICU and hospital length of stay
	* Significant ↑ in survival with transfer to an ECMO centre, even if you didn't get ECMO, compared to management in a non-ECMO centre
	* No protocolised ventilation in conventional group
	* Significant loss to follow up
