		* Initially planned for 8800 patients, powered at 90% for a 2.9% ARR in 90 day mortality
			* 23% control group mortality
			* 2% loss to followup
		* Revised to 5000 patients at start of COVID-19 pandemic as non-COVID research suspended and funding diverted\
		90% power for 3.8% ARR in 90 day mortality.
	* Investigator-initiated, double-blinded, parallel-group, multicentre (53), block-randomised RCT
	* Saline vs. Plasmalyte 148
		* Saline group
			* 3.7L saline received over 6 days
			* 3.5% received >500mL plasmalyte
		* Plasmalyte group
			* 3.9L plasmalyte received over 6 days
			* 63% received >500mL saline
	* No difference (21.8% vs 22%) in 90-day mortality
