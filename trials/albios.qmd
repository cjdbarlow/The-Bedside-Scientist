	* 1818 Italians within 24 hours of severe sepsis, without head injury, heart failure, or specific indication for albumin
	* Multicentre (100) open-label, randomised trial, with stratification by ICU and time of sepsis onset
	* 80% power for 7.5% ARR (!) â†“ in 28-day mortality, with control mortality of 45% 
	* 20% albumin vs. crystalloid
