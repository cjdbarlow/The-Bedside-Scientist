	* 456 adults with hypotension and sepsis, without septic shock or other significant acute disease
	* Single-centre, blinded RCT
	* 300 patients provides 80% power to detect 20% ↑ "shock resolution" at 6 hours, compared to 60% in control group\
	MAP sustained >65mmHg >15 minutes with >2 hours of UO >0.5mL/kg/hr or ↓ lactate by >10% from initial level.
	* Noradrenaline vs. placebo
		* Noradrenaline
			* 0.05μg/kg/min for 24 hours without titration
		* D5W placebo
		* Open-label vasopressors if MAP <65
	* Greater shock resolution at 6 hours in noradrenaline group (76% vs 48%)
	* More interestingly, over half of the patients had norad given peripherally and no extravasation injuries occurred
