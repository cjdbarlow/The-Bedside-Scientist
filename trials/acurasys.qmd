	* 340 French adults intubated with ARDS for <48 hours with a P/F ratio <150mmHg
	* Multicentre (20), double-blind, block randomised trial
	* 80% power to detect 15% ↓ ARR (!) in 90 day mortality assuming control mortality of 50%
	* Cisatracurium vs. placebo for 2 days
		* Cisatracurium\
		15mg bolus then 37.5mg/hr.
		* Placebo
		* All patients received VCV and ARDSnet ventilation with 6-8mL/kg V~T~
	* Significant ↓ in adjusted 90 day mortality (Hazard Ratio 0.68, CI 0.48-0.98)
	* Underpowered due to lower than expected control mortality
	* Secondary outcomes:
		* No difference in actual mortality (32% vs. 41%)
		* ↓ Barotrauma in cisatracurium group
		* ↑ Organ failure days in cisatracurium group
