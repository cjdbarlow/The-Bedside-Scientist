	* 5982 mechanically ventilated Australian ICU patients
		* Expected to be ventilated >48 hours
		* Imminent death not expected
	* Cross-over cluster RCT (12 month period) with an ecological monitoring window (3 months)
	* Intervention group received 100 mg of colistin, 80 mg of tobramycin, and 125,000 or 2,000,000 IU of nystatin Q6H\
	Applied either to oropharynx or via NG/NJ tube; ↑ dose of nystatin was for NG/NJ administration.
	* No frequentist difference in:
		* Mortality (21.2% vs 22.8%)
		* Alive free of ventilation (62 vs 60)
		* *C. difficile* (0.5 vs 0.9%)
		* Adverse medication events
	* Bayesian mortality analysis suggests benefit
	* Significant frequentist ↓:
		* Antibiotic resistance (20.9% vs 32.5%)\
		i.e. Decontamination ↓ resistant organism culture.
		* Positive blood culture (5.6% vs 8.1%)
	* Waiver of consent
	* ~50% of control arm received IV antibiotics
	* Longer term resistance patterns not known
