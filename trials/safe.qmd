	* ~7000 Australian adult ICU patients requiring fluid administration, excluding post-cardiac surgery, liver transplant, and burns
	* Multicentre, double-blinded RCT, stratified by trauma diagnosis and site\
	Special fluid administration sets were used to hide the albumin.
	* 4% albumin vs. 0.9% saline
	* No change in 28-day mortality (20.9% vs. 21.1%)
	* No statistically significant difference in ICU length of stay, duration of organ support. However:
		* Trauma subgroup had an *almost* significant ↑ mortality (13.6% vs. 10%, RR 1.36 (CI 0.99-1.86))\
		* Sepsis subgroup had a more insignificant ↓ mortality (30.7% vs. 35.3%, RR 0.87 (CI 0.74-1.02))
	* Less cumulative fluid balance at end of day 1 and 2 in the albumin group (by ~1:1.4), although this difference started resolving at day 3 and had gone at day 4

Note that 4% Albumin is hypotonic at 260mOsmol/L. This may contribute to the poor outcomes seen in the neurosurgical group, and is explored elegantly by [Iguchi et al](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29458321/).
