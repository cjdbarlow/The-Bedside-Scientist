	* 950 adults with OOHCA from presumed cardiac cause and GCS <8
	* Multicentre (36), assessor blinded RCT
	* 900 patients provide 90% power to detect 20% ↓ in hazard ratio for death\
	This is ~11% ARR, which is very ambitious.
	* Therapeutic hypothermia at 36°C vs. 33°C\
	Both groups:
		* Targeted management for 28 hours
		* Invasive or surface cooling
		* Gradual warming to 37°C by 0.5°C/hr
		* Avoidance of fever for 72 hours
	* No mortality difference (50% vs. 48%; hazard ratio 0.89 (CI 0.89 to 1.28))\
	But probably underpowered for this outcome.
	* Reasonably good separation between groups
