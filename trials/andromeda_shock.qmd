	* 424 adult south Americans with septic shock requiring vasopressors despite 20mL/kg volume resuscitation 
	* Multicentre (28), randomised, clinician unblinded, assessor blinded
	* 90% power for 15% ARR (!) for mortality
	* Peripheral perfusion-targeted resuscitation vs. lactate targeted resuscitation
		* Peripheral perfusion
			* Finger pad capillary refill time Q30 minutely, then hourly until normalisation
			* Targeted capillary refill time <3s
		* Lactate targeted
			* Lactate measured Q2H for 8 hours
			* Targeting ↓ lactate by 20% every 2 hours until normal
		* Failure to normalise was targeted with escalating protocols:
			* Fluid responsiveness\
				* PPV or VTI change following passive leg raise
				* 500mL crystalloid 
			* Vasopressor test
				* MAP ↑ to 80-85
					* If target normalised, MAP maintained
					* Otherwise MAP target set to 65
			* Inodilator test
				* Dobutamine or milrinone
	* ↑ Mortality in lactate group (43.4% vs 34.9%)
	* Underpowered for outcome
