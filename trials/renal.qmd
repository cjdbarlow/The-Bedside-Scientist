	* ~1,500 Australasian ICU patients requiring CRRT
	* Multi-centre (35) RCT
	* 90% power for 8.5% ARR in mortality from control group mortality of 60%\
	This was described as a "conservative" effect.
	* High-intensity (40mL/kg/hr) vs. low-intensity (25mL/kg/hr) CRRT
		* High-intensity received an average of 33.4mL/kg/hr
		* Low-intensity received an average of 22mL/kg/hr
	* No change in mortality (44.7% vs. 44.7%)
	* Significantly â†‘ hypophosphataemia in high-intensity group
