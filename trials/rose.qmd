	* 1006 Americans with moderate-severe ARDS (P/F <150), with several appropriate exclusions including BMI >100
	* Multi-centre (48), unblinded, block randomised trial
	* 1408 patients provide 90% power for 9% ↓ mortality, based on control group mortality of 35%
	* Deep sedation and paralysis vs. light sedation for average 48 hours
		* Intervention
			* Deep sedation
			* Cisatracurium\
			15mg bolus then 37.5mg/hr.
		* Control
			* Light sedation
			* 25% received NMBA
		* Sedation to RASS 0 to -1
		* Managed with high PEEP
	* Stopped early for futility
	* No change in mortality (42.5% vs 42.8%)
	* Secondary outcomes: ↑ Cardiac SAE in intervention group
	* 80% of screened patients excluded, with a large number already receiving NMBA
