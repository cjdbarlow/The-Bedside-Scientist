	* Theorised that mild hypercapnoea may lead to cerebral vasodilatation, ↑ CBF, and ↑ neurological outcome
	* 1700 non-pregnant, non-head injured adults with witnessed OOHVFA of presumed cardiac or idiopathic cause with >20 minutes of ROSC
	* Multicentre (63), international, assessor-blinded, allocation concealed, RCT
	* Mild hypercapnoea (50-55mmHg) vs. normocapnoea for 24 hours
		* Severe metabolic acidosis corrected prior
		* Normocapnoea restored over 24-48 hours in hypercapnoic group
		* RASS -4 in both groups
	* No change in favourable outcome (43.5% vs. 44.6%)
	* Good separation of groups
