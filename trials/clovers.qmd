	* ~12,000 patients with sepsis and hypotension after 1L IVT
		* Within 24 hours of hospital admission
		* \<3L of IVT\
		i.e. 1-3L of IVT received by randomisation.
	* Restrictive vs. liberal fluid strategy
		* Restrictive: Up to 2L IVT, then noradrenaline\
		Rescue fluids allowed.
		* Liberal: 2L bolus at randomisation, further 500mL boluses\
		Rescue vasopressors allowed, and recommended after 5L (6-8L total) IVT.
	* No change in mortality, ventilator free days, ICU free days, ARDS
	* â†‘ ICU admission in restrictive group
	* Strong safety profile of peripheral vasopressors
