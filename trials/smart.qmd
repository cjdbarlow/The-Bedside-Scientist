	* ~16,000 adult Americans admitted to ICU
	* Unblinded, cluster-randomised, single-centre (but multiple ICU), multiple crossover trial\
	ICU randomised to either 0.9% saline or a balanced crystalloid, and altered fluid each month. Associated ED and OR were given the same fluid, except for cardiac surgery patients.
	* 14,000 patients gives 90% power to detect 1.9% ↓ in major adverse kidney events at 30 days, from 15% in saline group\
	Composite outcome of death, RRT, or persistent renal dysfunction (last inpatient creatinine >200% of baseline). Censored at 30 days or discharge.
	* Balanced vs. normal saline
		* Balanced
			* Plasmalyte vs. lactated Ringer's
			* Normal saline could be given if hyperkalaemic or TBI
	* ↓ Primary outcome in balanced group (14.3% vs. 15.4%, OR 0.91 (CI 0.84-0.99))
	* Secondary outcomes show no difference in any of the components of subgroup analyses
	* Patients in ICU over the end of a calendar month may have received both therapies

It is worth noting that hyperkalaemia should not be an exclusion to balanced crystalloids; the acidosis generated from administration of saline results in a greater ↑ in serum [K^+^] than the potassium content of a balanced solution does.
