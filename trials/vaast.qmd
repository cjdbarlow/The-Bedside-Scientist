	* ~800 adults with septic shock, without mesenteric ischaemia, hyponatraemia, or TBI
	* Double-blind, randomised trial, stratified by shock severity
	* 80% power to detect 10% (!) ↓ ARR from baseline mortality of 60%
	* Vasopressin vs. noradrenaline
		* Vasopressin up to 0.03 units/minute (3.6 units/hr)
		* Noradrenaline up to 15μg/minute
		* Open label infusion if maximal rate reached
		* Cross-over to vasopressin was not allowed for noradrenaline group
	* No change in 28 day mortality (35.4% vs 39.3%)
	* Vasopressin is safe, at least up to ~4 units/hr

The VAAST protocol provides a crude dose-conversion between noradrenaline and vasopressin, with 1 unit/hr of vasopressin being *roughly* equivalent to 8μg/minute of noradrenaline.
