	* ~8000 Britons >16 with OOHCA undergoing ALS where adrenaline was indicated
	* Multicentre (5 ambulance services), randomised, double-blind trial
	* Powered for 1.5% ↑ in 30 day survival from a control group event rate of 6%
	* Adrenalin vs. placebo
		* Adrenaline group
			* Average 4.9 doses
			* 3980 shocks
		* Placebo
			* Average 5.1 doses
			* 3962 shocks
	* 21% had initially shockable rhythm
	* Adrenaline group had significantly ↑:
		* ROSC (36% vs 11%)
		* Transfer to hospital (50% vs 30%)
		* Survival at 30 days (3.2% vs 2.4%)
	* No difference in survival with favourable neurological outcome (mRS ⩽3)
		* The survivors in the adrenaline group had ↑ severity of neurological impairment
	* Reinforces the importance of good, early bystander CPR and defibrillation
