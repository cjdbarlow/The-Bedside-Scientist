	* 838 anaemic (Hb <90g/dL) Canadians with >24 hour expected ICU stay, without active bleeding, chronic anaemia, or post-cardiac surgery
	* Multicentre, non-blinded, randomised trial
	* 1620 patients provides 95% power for a 27.5% RRR from a liberal transfusion mortality of 27%
	* Restrictive vs. liberal transfusion	
		* Restrictive\
		Transfusion threshold: Hb <70g/dL
		* Liberal\
		Transfusion threshold: <100g/dL
	* No change in 30 day mortality (18.7% vs. 23.3%)
	* Secondary outcomes: Higher hospital mortality in liberal group
	* Grossly underpowered without explanation as to why
