	* 154 β-blocker-naive Italians with sepsis and a normal CI requiring noradrenaline admitted to a single ICU in Rome
	* Single-centre, phase 2, unblinded RCT
	* Randomised to esmolol vs. usual care
		* Esmolol group had infusion adjusted to achieve HR 80-94
		* All patients received:
			* PAC
			* Hydrocortisone 300mg/day via continuous infusion
			* Levosimendan if ↓ DO~2~ and Hb >80
			* CVP and PCWP guided fluid resuscitation and MvO~2~
	* Significant ↓ in HR and mortality in esmolol group, which must be contextualixed against the... high... 80% control group mortality
	* High dose vasopressors at randomisation (~0.4μg/kg/min NA), despite normal lactates
