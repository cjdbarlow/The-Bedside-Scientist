	* Non-pregnant adults requiring transfusion, without a previous blood transfusion, haematological disease, transplant, or after cardiac surgery\
	Cardiac surgery excluded due to low mortality.
	* Multicentre (59), double-blinded, allocation-concealed, RCT
	* 90% power to detect 4.2% ↓ in 90 day mortality, assuming 28% control mortality
	* Freshest vs. oldest blood
		* Fresh
			* Mean storage 11.8 +/- 5.3 days
		* Old
			* Mean storage 22.4 +/- 7.5 days
	* No mortality difference (24.8% vs. 24.1%)
	* Secondary outcomes showed no difference except ↑ febrile non-haemolytic reactions in fresh group
	* This is the definitive trial on this topic
