	* 405 Canadians patients with OOHCA arrest with refractory VF arrest\
	Refractory >3 consecutive rhythm checks demonstrating VF.
	* Initial shocks performed with A-L pad placement
	* Groups randomised then to one of three groups:
		* No change
		* Vector change: Pads moved to A-P defibrillation
		* Double-sequence: A-P pads added and sequenced (<1s between shocks) A-L and A-P defibrillation
	* Double-sequence defibrillation resulted in significant ↑:
		* ROSC (46% vs 26%)
		* Survival to hospital discharge (30% vs 13%)
		* Survival with mRS ⩽2 (27% vs 11%)
	* Vector-change defibrillation resulted in significant ↑ survival to hospital discharge (21.7% vs 13.3%) but no significant change in ROSC or neurological outcome.
	* Stopped early with a low number of outcomes; ↑↑ risk bias\
	Stoppage due to paramedic staffing shortages.
	* Median time to 1^st^ shock ~10 minutes
