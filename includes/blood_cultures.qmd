* Blood cultures
	* Strict aseptic process should be performed to minimise contamination:
		* Skin cleaning:
			* 2% chlorhexidine/70% isopropyl alcohol
			* 1-2% alcoholic iodine
		* Clean blood culture bottle with 70+% alcohol\
		Avoiding cleaning with antiseptic as it may degrade the stopper.
		* Aseptic venepuncture
		* Introduction of blood into bottles can occur with the same needle
	* To **minimise false negative risk**, take:
		* **2-3 samples** from **separate sites** through **intact skin**
		* **20mL** (10mL for each bottle) minimum for each draw
		* Cultures **prior** to **antibiotics**
	* Culture to identify resolution of bacteraemia should occur 48-96 hours following initiation of appropriate therapy
