Haemolysis screen consists of:

* **Reticulocyte** count\
↑ Due to ↑ marrow turnover.
* Blood film
	* Schistocytes\
	Mechanically fragmented erythrocyte, favours intravascular mechanical haemolysis.
* **LDH**\
Present in many cells and so not specific for haemolysis (as opoposed to other cellular destruction). Substantial ↑ (4-5× ULN) favours intravascular over extravascular haemolysis. 
* **Haptoglobin**\
Binds free haemoglobin, and is non-specific for intravascular vs. extravascular haemolysis. Acute phase reactant and so result may be equivocal in inflammatory states.
* **Free Hb**\
↑ Due to cellular destruction.
* **Bilirubin**\
↑ Due to haemoglobin metabolism. Classically ↑ conjugated bilirubin, although unconjugated may ↑ in concurrent hepatic impairment.
