Brain death occurs when ICP exceeds arterial perfusion pressure and cerebral blood flow ceases. This leads to a relatively predictable pattern of autonomic responses:

* Autonomic storm
	* Transient â†‘ BP with vasoconstriction, tachyarrhythmia
	* Less commonly tachypnoea, seizures, sweating, pupillary dilation
* Autonomic collapse
	* Loss of **reflex brainstem activity**
	* Loss of **respiratory drive**
	* Loss of **temperature regulation**
	* Loss of **vascular tone** and **HR regulation**
	* **DI**
