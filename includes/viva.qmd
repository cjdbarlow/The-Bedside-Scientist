The oral section aims to assess whether you are ready to matriculate from training and assume the mantle of consultant. This is far more a question of mindset than of knowledge. Therefore:

* **Embody the consultant**
	* Decide the type of consultant you want to be
	* Be that person
	* Have (or fake) confidence
* Engage with the consultant examiner as a respected equal
* Immerse yourself in the scenario
* Take some time to think of an answer\
But not too much.
* Be authentic
* Discuss balance of risks without waffling
* If you are unsure of a course of action, then describe your rationale
* Have some prepared statements phrases
	* "In addition to my usual anaesthetic assessment..."
	* Know what to say if you don't know what to do


Pitfalls:

* Attitude
	* Non-consultant like
	* Indecisive\
	Using 'could' not 'would.'
	* Inflexible
		* Refusing to be lead
	* Waffling
	* Too many lists
	* Does not answer question
* Knowledge
	* Insufficient
	* Long checklists do not demonstrate understanding
	* Inaccurate
	* Not recognising knowledge gaps\
	Demonstrates lack of safety.
* Safety
	* Inappropriate drug doses
	* Does not know how to manage a crisis
	* Lacks insight
	* Refuses to accept guidance
