	Choice depends on timing, IV access, and drug availability.
		* **Premonitory**
			* **10mg** SL or **IN midazolam**
			* 10-20mg PR diazepam
		* **Emergent initial therapy** (1^st^ line)\
		Benzodiazepines Q2-5 minutely:
			* **Lorazepam 0.1mg/kg** IV\
			Preferred IV option, if available.
			* Diazepam 0.1mg/kg IV
			* Midazolam 0.1mg/kg IV/0.2mg/kg IM\
			Preferred IM option, if available.
		* **Urgent control therapy** (2^nd^ line)\
		One of:
			* **Levetiracetam** 60mg/kg up to 4.5g
				* No levels required
			* Phenytoin 20mg/kg IV load, given at 50mg/min, up to 1.5g\
			Always should be combined with a benzodiazepine for seizure termination.
			* Valproate 40mg/kg IV load up to 3g
				* Level 2-4 hours following load
			* Midazolam infusion at 0.05-0.4mg/kg/hr\
			Phenobarbital (below) can be used as an alternative.
		* **Refractory therapy** (3^rd^ line)\
			* Transition to continuous infusions
			* Duration of therapy usually dictated by EEG
			* Consideration of:
				* **Anaesthetic agents**\
				Continue infusions for **12-48 hours** before attempting to wean therapy. Options include:
					* Thiopental 100-250mg IV
					* Propofol 2mg/kg IV, then infusion at 5-10mg/kg/hr
					* Phenobarbital 10-15mg/kg IV, given at 100mg/min
				* Ketogenic diet\
				Considered dual 3^rd^ line in some institutions.
	* Maintenance antiepileptic\
	All have demonstrated equivalence, but levetiracetam is the most logistically convenient.
		* **Levetiracetam**
			* **60mg/kg** IV load
		* Phenytoin
			* **20mg/kg** IV load
			* Wait **2 hours** before checking levels following loading dose
			* May precipitate hypotension
			* Avoid if usually on phenytoin
			* Avoid if drug induced seizures
		* Valproate
			* **40mg/kg** IV load
			* Non-sedating
			* Levels can be checked immediately
