High-dose Insulin Euglycaemic Therapy:

* Overcomes cardiac metabolic starvation that occurs with cardiac toxidromes\
Classically Ca^2+^-channel blocker, but also β-blocker toxicity.
* ↑ Glucose and lactate uptake by myocardium
* Positive inotrope without ↑ oxygen demand\
\
* Initial therapy:
	* 25g 50mL 50% dextrose unless BSL >22mol/L
	* 1 unit/kg IV insulin
* Continuation:
	* Dextrose 25g/hr, titrated to euglycaemia\
	Monitor Q20min for first hour, and hourly thereafter.
	* Insulin at 0.5 unit/kg/hr up to 5unit/kg/hr\
	* Insulin dose should be titrated to toxicity, and dextrose dose titrated to maintain euglycaemia
* Replace potassium if K <2.5mmol/L
* Cease when clinical resolution of toxicity and ECG abnormalities
