All methods of renal replacement therapy rely on one or more basic physical principles:

* **Ultrafiltration**\
Generation of a **transmembrane pressure** that exceeds the oncotic pressure, resulting in net loss of water across the dialysis membrane. This is achieved by:
	* Relative pressurisation of the blood relative to the dialysate, ↑ hydrostatic pressure
	* ↑ Osmolality of the dialysate, drawing water across the membrane
* **Diffusion**\
Generation of an **electro-chemical gradient** across the membrane. Rate of diffusion is affected by:
	* Molecular weight
	* Membrane porosity
	* Blood flow rate
* **Convection** (Solvent drag)\
