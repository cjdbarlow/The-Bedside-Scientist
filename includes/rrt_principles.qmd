### Physical

Principles:

* **Ultrafiltration**\
Generation of a **transmembrane pressure** that exceeds the oncotic pressure, resulting in net loss of water across the dialysis membrane. This is achieved by:
	* Relative pressurisation of the blood relative to the dialysate, ↑ hydrostatic pressure
	* ↑ Osmolality of the dialysate, drawing water across the membrane

:::column-margin
$TMP = {P_{Filter} + P_{Return} \over 2} - {P_{Effluent}}$\
\
Where:

* $TMP$ = Transmembrane Pressure
* $P$ = Pressure
:::

* **Diffusion**\
Generation of an **electro-chemical gradient** across the membrane. Rate of diffusion is affected by:
	* Molecular weight
	* Membrane porosity
	* Blood flow rate
* **Convection** (Solvent drag)\
Passive transport of sol*ute* particles across a semipermeable membrane along with the movement of sol*vent*.


Values:

* **Sieving Coefficient**\
Describes how effectively a given solute is removed.
	* A high value indicates effective clearance

:::column-margin
$SC = {[UF] \over [Blood]}$\
\
Where:

* $SC$ = Sieving coefficient
* $UF$ = Ultrafiltrate
:::

* **Filtration Fraction**\
Fraction of plasma removed from blood during filtration.	

:::column-margin
$FF = {Rate_{UF} \over Rate_{Blood}} = {Rate_{UF} \over Rate_{Blood \ Pump} \times (1 - Hct)}$\
\
Where:

* $FF$ = Filtration Fraction
* $UF$ = Ultrafiltrate
* $Hct$ = Haematocrit

### Practical

* **Dose**\
**Effluent** production in mL/kg/hr.
	* CRRT dose should generally be **20-25mL/hr**\
		* This typically requires a prescription of 25-30mL/hr due to interruptions
		* Higher doses are not associated with improved outcome
		* Higher doses may be used in liver failure to ↑ ammonia clearance, with little evidence
	* Hypotension and electrolyte disturbances are more common at higher intensities (dosing) and are not associated with improved outcome
	* Composition of effluent varies depending on the:
		* Use of pre-filter dilution
		* Mechanism of effluent production
			* Ultrafiltration\
			i.e. TMP driven.
			* Diffusion\
			i.e. Dialysis flow rate driven.
* **Fluid removal**\
Difference between:
	* Effluent production
	* Pre-filter diluent
	* Post-filter replacement
