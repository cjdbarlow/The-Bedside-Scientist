Correcting sodium for glucose allows the presence of an underlying sodium disorder to be quantified. A variety of calculations exist, consider:

$Na_{corr} = Na_{serum} - {Glucose \over 4}$

Where:

* $Na_{corr}$ is the corrected sodium in mmol/L
* $Na_{serum}$ is the measured sodium in mmol/L
* $Glucose$ is the BSL in mmol/L

Note that the serum sodium is a true indication of the current electrolyte composition of the serum, and so the *un*corrected value should be used for other calculations, such as the anion gap.
