* In mixed MS and MR\
Competing haemodynamic disease that is a common conundrum in rheumatic disease. In general:
	* In asymmetric disease, prioritise the most significant lesion
	* Otherwise aim maintenance of stable pre-induction haemodynamic parameters, i.e.:
		* Maintain normal afterload
		* Maintain normal HR
		* Maintain normal contractility
		* Avoid â†‘ PVR
		* Provide adequate preload
