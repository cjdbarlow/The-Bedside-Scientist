* C
	* **Control** of **blood pressure**
		* Target SBP 140-150mmHg and DBP 90-100mmHg
		* Strategy depends on severity of hypertension
			* Hypertensive crisis:
				* Labetalol
					* 20-80mg IV over 2 minutes\
					Can repeat every 10 minutes.
				* Nifedipine
					* 10-20mg PO IR
				* Hydralazine\
					* 10mg IV Q20 minutes
				* GTN\
				For hypertension and APO
* D
	* **Seizure prophylaxis**
		* **Magnesium Sulphate**
			* **Prophylaxis** and treatment for **eclampsia** in women with **severe pre-eclampsia**\
			Not recommended for use as an antihypertensive agent.
			* Multifactorial mechanism of action:
				* ↑ Prostacyclin synthesis
				* ↓ Calcium influx\
				Thereby ↓ ATP-consuming Ca^2+^-dependent processes.
				* NMDA antagonism
			* Give **4g over 20 minutes**, and then **1g/hr** thereafter
			* Target level is **1.7-3.5mmol/L**
			* Blood levels should be performed:
				* Q6H in women with renal impairment
				* If any of:
					* RR < 12
					* UO < 100ml over 4 hours
					* **Loss** of **patella reflexes**
					* Seizures\
					Including repeat seizures.
			* Magnesium toxicity
				* Associated with muscular weakness, rarely respiratory arrest
				* Unlikely if deep tendon reflexes present
				* Treated with:
					* Calcium
					* RRT
		* Anticonvulsants\
			* Conventional anticonvulsants are only indicated for:
				* Persistent seizures (>5 minutes) with therapeutic magnesium levels
				* Magnesium contraindication
			* Benzodiazepines
				* Lorazepam 4mg IV
				* Midazolam 1-2mg IV
