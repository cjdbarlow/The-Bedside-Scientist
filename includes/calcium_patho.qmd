Calcium is an important cation with multiple critical functions:

* Muscular contraction
* Coagulation
* Neurotransmission
* Hormone release
* Cellular apoptosis

Calcium homeostasis is regulated by:

* PTH\
	* Release stimulated by ↓ serum calcium and magnesium
	* ↑ Renal and bone reabsorption
	* ↑ Calcitriol production\
	↑ Gut calcium absorption.
* Vitamin D\
Calcitriol precursor.
* Calcitonin\
Functionally a PTH antagonist.
	* Release stimulated by hypercalcaemia, catecholamines, and gastrin
	* ↓ Bone reabsorption and ↑ renal elimination
