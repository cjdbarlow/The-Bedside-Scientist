* B
    * Parapneumonic **effusion**
        * Uncomplicated effusions resolve with resolution of the underlying infection
        * Complex effusions:
            * Develop 1-2 weeks after the initial fluid collection
            * May occur with persistent fevers and have organisms on Gram stain\
            Essentially empyema-lite.
    * **Empyema**
    Collection of pus in the pleural space, usually evolving from a parapneumonic effusion. Antibiotics are adjunctive - these require drainage.
    * Persistent **pneumonia**
    Pneumonia unresponsive to 5 days of appropriate antibiotic therapy, which should stimulate search for an alternate diagnosis or signs of a complicated infection.
