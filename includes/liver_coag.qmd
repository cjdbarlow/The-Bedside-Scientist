* H
	* Coagulopathy\
		* Patients may be prothrombotic, anti-thrombotic, or fibrinolytic
		* Assays themselves (both coagulation profiles and point-of-care testing) may not correlate with the observed clinical effect
		* Treat if bleeding or:
			* Prior to procedures
			* INR >5\
			May require continuous FFP infusion in unstable patients.
			* Fibrinogen <0.8
			* Platelets <20Ã—10^9^/L
		* Consider treating prior to procedures
		* Therapeutic options:
			* Vitamin K 10mg IV daily\
			Very reasonable, probably ineffective in the majority of patients.
			* PCC\
			Useful for factor replacement without volume load.
			* Fibrinogen\
			Target >1.5g/L. Dysfibrinogenaemia is likely in chronic disease.
	* Individualisation of thromboprophylaxis
