As with the primary examination, a structured answer format:

* Provides a scaffolding to hang ideas off and prompt your memory
	* ↑ The chance you will deliver a complete answer
* Buys you thinking time\
Your mind can think of content whilst you subconsciously outline the structure on the page.
* ↓ Stress
* Is less painful to read, and therefore more favourable to mark
