# Airway Assessment

:::info
* Predicting an anatomically difficult airway is unreliable
* When a predicted difficult airway exists, a plan should be developed to manage that particular difficulty
* Previous difficulty with a technique is the greatest predictor of difficulty with that technique
:::

Airway assessment involves identifying potential:

* Anatomical difficulty
* Physiological difficulty
* Situational difficulty

## Anatomical Difficulty

Anatomical difficulty can be further divided into difficulty with:

* Mask Ventilation
* SAD placement
* Intubation
* FOI
* FONA

Difficulty with one technique is associated with difficulty of other techniques.

Consider **elective cannulation of the cricothyroid membrane** if multiple anatomical difficulties exist.

### Difficult Mask Ventilation

Defined as inability to keep ventilate without:

* 2-person technique
* Airway adjuncts
* Paralysis

Assessment:

* Typically poorly predicted\
May be <20% of all patients.
* Risk ↑↑ with >1 risk factor

Risk Factors (**MBBS MAT**):

* **M**allampati III/IV
* **B**eard
* **B**MI >25
* **S**noring
* **M**ale
* **A**ge >55
* **T**eeth (lack of)\
Teeth are numbered:
	* Firstly by quadrant\
	Top-right, top-left, bottom-left, bottom-right.
		* Adult teeth are quadrants 1-4 respectively\
		Each quadrant has 8 teeth, for a total of 32.
		* Deciduous (baby) teeth are quadrants 5-8\
		Each quadrant has 5 teeth, for a total of 20.
	* Secondly by tooth number, from medial to lateral


### Difficult Intubation

Risk factors (**LEMON**):

* Cormack and **L**ehane Grading:\
Cook modification correlates better with time to intubate and requirement for adjuncts.\
![Cook Modification](/resources/c&lgradecookmod.png)
	* Grades are by best view, with or without ELM or BURP
	* This modification adds additional complexity\
	The author recommends subdividing into three tiers which have greater practical value:
		* Easy: Laryngeal inlet visible
		* Restricted: Posterior glottic structures visible\
		Likely amenable to bougie.
		* Difficult: Epiglottis cannot be lifted/No structures visible\
		Likely require specialist or blind techniques, and is associated with a significantly longer intubation time.
* **E**xternal anatomy\
The 3-3-2 rule is a crude predictor of difficult airway:
	* Interincisor distance <3cm
	* Thyromental distance <3cm
	* Hyoid-thyroid notch distance <1cm
* **M**allampati score\
MP 4 is associated with >10% change of difficult intubation.
* **O**bstruction
* **N**eck mobility\
Ability to assume the ear-to-sternal notch position.


### Difficult SAD Placement

Defined as inability to ventilate, requiring removal and tracheal intubation. SAD failure occurs in ~1% of instances, and is usually due to:

* Leak
* Obstruction

Risk Factors (**PROMPT**):

* **P**oor respiratory compliance
* **R**estricted mouth opening
* **O**besity
* **M**ale
* **P**osition\
Non-level operating table.
* **T**eeth (poor)


### Difficult FOI

Risks:

* FOI failure occurs in ~1.5% of instances. 
* Epistaxis occurs in ~10%
	* Severe epistaxis occurs in ~1.3%


### Difficult FONA

Risk factors (**SHORT**):

* **S**urgery 
* **H**aematoma
* **O**besity
* **R**adiation
* **T**umour


## Physiological Difficulty

Key physiological states that affect induction are the **VAPOURS**:

* **Ventilation**\
PPV may have many detrimental effects:
	* Reduce VR and therefore BP
	* Volutrauma and barotrauma
	* Gastric insufflation
* **Acidaemia**\
Very high minute ventilation may be compensating for metabolic acidosis\
	* Rendering the patient apnoeic may lead to a rapid ↑ in PaCO~2~, fall in pH, and precipitate cardiac arrest
		* **Consider gentle BMV during the apnoeic period to reduce this risk**\
		This needs to be balanced against the risk of gastric insufflation and aspiration.
	* Use ETCO~2~ during preoxygenation to identify what the patients (compensating) ETCO~2~ is prior to induction
	* Aim for an ETCO~2~ **at least as low** post-induction
* **Pressures**\
Important pressures to consider (**ABG**):
	* **Airway** pressures\
	Avoid excessive airway pressures (Aim Pplat <30 cmH~2~O):
		* Auto-PEEP\
		↑ RV afterload, reducing VR and subsequently BP.
			* **Beware hypoxia secondary to impaired circulation** due to this reason, and avoid ↑ minute ventilation further\
			Ensure **adequate time for expiration**, especially in patients with obstructive lung disease.
		* Barotrauma
	* **Systemic arterial pressure**\
	Aim for a higher systemic BP prior to induction.
	* **Pulmonary arterial pressure**\
	PAP will also be affected by pH and PAO~2~. **Defend the systemic MAP** to maintain RV perfusion.
	* **Gastric** pressure
* **Oxygenation**\
Hypoxia is:
	* What kills patients during prolonged attempts at intubation
	* More important than ventilation, **except** at extremes of pH\
	A starting pH of 7.1 will lead to a pH of ~6.9 after 4 minutes of apnoea (assuming a normal VCO~2~).
	* Reduced by:
		* Adequate denitrogenation\
		↑ FRC oxygen concentration and therefore oxygen reserve.
		* Lung recruitment\
		↑ FRC volume.
* **Underlying disease**
* **Regurgitation**\
Consider the risks of aspiration and other airway contaminants (e.g. blood).
* **Shock Index**\
$SI = {HR \over BP}$. If the SI is >1, then consider initiating vasopressors/volume prior to intubation. If using vasopressor infusions, then prepare these prior.
	* Dose ↓ sedatives\
	Up to **90%**.
	* Dose ↑ relaxants
	* Aggressively treat hypotension
