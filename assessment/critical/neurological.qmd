# Detailed Neurological Examination

The neurological exam comes in several flavours, depending on the patient:

* Paralysed
    * Pupilliary
* Unconscious
    * Pupillary
    * Vestibulo-ocular reflex
* Uncooperative
* Cooperative


## Paralysed Patient

Paralysis permits only examination of the pupils:

* **Pupils**
    * Papilloedema  
    Suggests raised ICP; may not be present (especially acutely).
    * **Size**  
    Different sized pupils suggetss different aetiology of the lesion:
        * Small  
            * Drugs  
            Opioids and clonidine.
            * Pontine lesions
        * Semidilated and unresponsive  
        Midbrain lesions.
        * Large and unresponsive  
        CNIII compression.
    * **Asymmetry**
        * Large and unresponsive  
            * Ipsilateral CN III lesion
            * Adie's Pupil  
            Idiopathic syndrome of mydriasis and delayed response to light; may occur in one or both pupils.
    * **Reactivity**
        * Afferent pathway via CN II
        * Efferent pathway via CN III
        * Abnormalities between direct and consensual reflexes allow localisation of the lesion to a particular neural pathway


## Unconscious

In addition to the pupillary exam, examination of the unconscious patient can include:

### Cranial Nerves

* **Dysconjugate gaze**
    * Exophoria is present in most patients with altered conscous state

* **Corneal reflex**  
Tests V<sub>1</sub> and VII.
    * A drop of saline or wisp of cotton should be applied to the cornea  
    Patient should not see the or hear the stimulus, otherwise this will not test V<sub>1</sub>.


* **Oculo-cephalic reflex**  
Tests CN III, VI, VIII.
    * A milder version of the cold caloric reflex that can be performed in unconscious patients
    * The eyes are held open and the head is rotated side-to-side or up and down
    * The reflex is present if the eyes move in the opposite direction of head movements (**doll's eyes**)
    * Absence of the reflex is suggestive of brainstem dysfunction in the comatose patient


* **Cold caloric reflex**  
Tests CN III, VI, and VIII.
    * Used in brain-death testing
    * Cold water is syringed into the patients ear
    * A positive reflex occurs when the eyes look towards the tested side  
    Eyes will remain in this position until irrigation stops.
    * No response will occur in brain death
    * 5 minutes should elapse before testing the other wide


* **Facial Sensation**
    * Supra orbital notch pressure  
    Tests CN V, VII.
        * Best method of assessing response to a painful stimulus


* **Gag reflex**  
Tests CN IX, X.
    * Touch the posterior pharynx on each side (use a Yankeur)
    * A gag is a positive response


* **Cough reflex**  
Tests CN X.
    * Suctioning the trachea should cause a cough response


### Extremities

> * Asymmetry in tone, reflexes, and plantar responses are useful to lateralise a lesion
> * Symmetrical changes are rarely helpful in the unconscious patient


* Observation
    * Spontaneous or localising movements  
    * Posturing
        * Abnormal flexion (decorticate posturing)  
        Indicates a lesion above the brainstem. Movements are:
            * Flexion of arms
            * Adduction of shoulder
            * Extension of legs
        * Abnormal extension (decerebrate posturing)  
        Indicates a lesion at the brainstem or below. Movements are:
            * Extension of arms
            * Internal rotation of shoulder
    * Tremors
    * Wasting
    * Fasciculations
        * Intrinsic hand muscles
        * Shoulder girdle
        * Thigh

* Tone
    * Passive movement of each joint
* Power and movement
    * Response to noxious stimuli  
    Should always be a central stimulus, either supraorbital pressure or endotracheal suctioning.
    * Drift
    * Rapid movements
    * Power
* Reflexes
    * Clonus  
    \>5 sustained involuntary contractions following stretching of a muscle.
    * Plantar response  
    Sensitive test for the presence of an UMN lesion in the corticospinal tract.
        * Lateral side of foot is rubbed with a blunt instrument
        * Flexion of the toes is a normal response
        * Extension of the hallux with fanning of the toes is a positive Babinski sign  
        Present as a primitive reflex in infants up to 12 months of age.


Upper versus Lower Motor Neuron Lesions:

|Finding|UMN|LMN|
|--|--|--|
|Atrophy|No|Yes
|Fasciculations|No|Yes
|Reflexes|Increased|Decreased
|Tone|Increased|Decreased
|Weakness|Yes|Yes




## Cooperative Patient

Examination of the cooperative patient can include:

### Cranial Nerves

* **Visual acuity**  
Tests CN II
    * Visual fields
        * Patient focuses straight ahead
        * Reports when a finger is moving in each quadrant
    * Visual extinction
        * Form of neglect
        * Patient is presented with a different number of fingers on each side
        * The patient will not report seeing the fingers on the affected side when presented to both sides, but can see them when presented to the affected side alone


* **Extra-ocular movements**  
Tests CN III, IV, VI
    * Patient focuses straight ahead
    * Eyes follow finger in an 'H' pattern
    * Diplopia:
        * Movement limitation
        * Dysconjugate gaze:
        * Horizontal
        * Vertical


* **Facial Sensation**
    * Trigeminal sensation  
    Tests CN V<sub>1</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>, V<sub>3</sub>.


* **Facial Expression**  
Tests CN VII.
    * Evaluate strength and asymmetry as the patient:
        * Wrinkles brow
        * Closes eyes tightly
        * Puffs out cheeks
        * Smiles    


* **SCM and trapezius**  
Tests CN XI.
    * Evaluate strength as the patient:
        * Shrugs shoulders
        * Turns head to each side

* **Tongue**  
Tests CN XII.
    * Atrophy  
    Occurs with LMN lesion.
    * Fasciculations  
    Occurs with LMN lesions.
    * Deviation  
    Weakness causes deviation to the affected side.
    * Push forcefully against inside of the cheek


### Cerebellar Exam

* Nystagmus
    * A fast phase of nystagmus will occur towards the side of a cerebellar lesion
* Resting tremor
* Tests of coordination:
    * Rapid alternating movements
    * Finger-nose
    * Heel-shin
* Gait
    * Heel-toe
* Romberg's test
    * Patient stands with eyes closed
    * A positive result occurs if the patient loses balance
        * Cerebellar ataxia occurs even when the eyes are open
        * Sensory ataxia occurs when the eyes are closed, and is a sign of disturbed proprioception

### Motor Exam

Motor assessment involves:

* Appearance
    * Normal muscle bulk for age
    * Symmetry of muscle bulk
    * Tremors  
    Should be no tremors at rest in normal individuals.
* Palpation
* Tone  
Joint should be able to be moved easily through its range of motion.
    * Spasticity  
    Increase in tone is proportional to the rate of movement. Associated with UMN lesion.
    * Rigidity  
    Tone is increased irrespective of how quickly the joint is moved.
    * Flaccidness  
    Complete absence of tone, occurring when the muscle has no LMN innervation.
* Power  
Assessment must consider the age, sex, fitness, and non-neurological disease state. Power assessment is:
    * Graded on a scale:
        * 0: No movement
        * 1: Fasciculations
        * 2: Movement when gravity is eliminated
        * 3: Movement capable of overcoming gravity but not additional resistance
        * 4: Movement capable of overcoming some resistance  
        Additional (subjective) nuance can be documented by using 4+ or 4- for varying levels of "some" resistance.
        * 5: Normal

### Sensory Exam

Testing of each main afferent pathway:

* Spinothalamic tracts  
Pain, temperature, crude touch.
* Dorsal columns  
Proprioception, vibration, light touch. 


Assessment process:

* Sharp and light touch
    * Demonstrate to the patient what light and sharp touch will feel like
    * Start distally and move proximally, crossing multiple dermatomes at each point
* Proprioception 
    * Have the patient close their eyes
    * Grasp either side of the great toe IP joint
    * Orientate the patient to what up and down will be
    * Then move the toe and ask the patient to state in which direction it has been moved
        * If incorrect, then move to a more proximal joint  
        Distal joints are typically affected first.
* Vibration
    * Use a 128Hz tuning fork
    * Place the fork over the great toe IP joint
    * The patient should be able to identify when vibration occurs, and when vibration ceases
* Two-point discrimination  
Useful for peripheral neuropathy.
    * Patient should be able to distinguish simultaneous touch from two objects >5mm apart
