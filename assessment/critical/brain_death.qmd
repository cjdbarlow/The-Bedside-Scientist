# Brain Death {#sec-braindeath}

:::info
Brain death and circulatory death are both death, and do not differ in type but in the way they are determined.
:::

**Brain Death** is the irreversible loss of all functions of the brain, including the brainstem. 


## Pathophysiology

Brain death occurs when ICP exceeds arterial perfusion pressure and cerebral blood flow ceases. This leads to a relatively predictable pattern of autonomic responses:

* Autonomic storm
	* Transient ↑ BP with vasoconstriction, tachyarrhythmia
	* Less commonly tachypnoea, seizures, sweating, pupillary dilation
* Autonomic collapse
	* Loss of **reflex brainstem activity**
	* Loss of **respiratory drive**
	* Loss of **temperature regulation**
	* Loss of **vascular tone** and **HR regulation**
	* **DI**


## Determination of Brain Death

:::info
The definitions and process discussed here are specific to brain death in the Australian context, which requires **whole brain death**. Some other jurisdictions accept brain-stem death as sufficient, and vary as to the procedural requirements to determine brain death.
:::

Determination of brain death requires:

* Meeting preconditions
* Clinical testing\
Consists of:
	* Observation period
	* Formal testing by two clinicians

:::column-margin
Time of death is the completion of examination by the second doctor.
:::

### Preconditions

For brain stem testing to be appropriate, the following preconditions must be met:

:::column-margin
Due to the immaturity of brain-stem reflexes, brain death cannot be determined in preterm neonates, and ↑ caution should be used in neonates and infants.
:::

* A **brain lesion consistent with a diagnosis of brain death**\
Neuroimaging consistent with acute brain pathology that could cause brain death. Only in the case of HIE is imaging not required, and the diagnosis may be made on history alone.
* **Absence of physiological** and **anatomical perturbations** that could confound assessment:
	* No high cervical spine injury\
	Must be able to assess:
		* Upper limb motor response to central stimulus
		* Central response (grimace) to upper limb stimulus
		* Cough reflex
	* Normothermia\
	≥ 36.5°C.
	* Normotensive 
	SBP ≥90mmHg/MAP >60mmHg in adults, or age-appropriate perfusion pressure in children.
	* No sedation, analgesia 
	Time for assessment depends on the drugs used and the degree of renal or hepatic dysfunction.
		* Drug antagonists can be used if concern about persisting effects
		* Thiopentone plasma levels should be <10mg/L
	* No muscle relaxation\
	Confirm with train-of-four.
	* Absence of severe metabolic, endocrine, and electrolyte derangements
		* Glucose: <3 or >25mmol/L
		* Sodium: <125 or >160mmol/L
		* Phosphate: <0.5mmol/L
		* Magnesium: <0.5mmol/L
		* Urea: >40mmol/L
		* Severe hypothyroidism
		* Severe hypoadrenalism
* **Ability to perform clinical testing**\
	* Ability to assess brain stem reflexes\
	At least one eye and ear.
	* Ability to perform apnoea test\
	Neuromuscular system capable of independent respiration (e.g. no high cervical spine injury), saturations able to be maintained with supplemental oxygen.


### Clinical Testing

:::info
Each Australian state has slightly different requirements around the qualifications, experience, and relationship to the patient of the clinicians determining brain death.
:::

:::column-margin
Family should be offered the opportunity to observe clinical testing, after appropriate explanation (particularly about **spinal reflexes**) and support. Consider using the second set of testing, as the family can be warned about any spinal reflexes that may occur.
:::

Prior to performing clinical testing, a minimum of **4 hours** of observation should be performed during which the:

:::column-margin
The observation period should be extended to **24** hours in the case of HIE or hypothermia >6 hours.
:::

* **Preconditions** are **met**
* **GCS** is **3**
* Non-reactive pupils
* No spontaneous respiratory effort
* Absent cough reflex

:::column-margin
Since all patients undergoing brain death testing will be intubated, GCS 3 = GCS 2T.
:::

Clinical testing is performed **separately** by two suitably trained and experienced clinicians (at least one a specialist), and requires:

* **Coma**\
GCS 3; with a motor response provided centrally and to all four limbs.
* **Absence** of **brainstem reflexes**\
Should be tested **sequentially** and **bilaterally**.
	* Pupils fixed and non-reactive
	* No corneal reflex\
	Use of cotton wool or gauze are appropriate stimuli. 
	* No oculo-vestibular reflexes\
	Cold ice water injected into each EAM via a small catheter until either:
		* Nystagmus\
		Slow-phase towards irrigated ear in intact brainstem.
		* Ocular deviation
		* 20mL given
	* No gag\
	Use a tongue depressor or cotton swab. A laryngoscope can be used for assistance, if required.
	* No cough
* **Apnoea**\
Conducted last so that an ↑ PaCO~2~ does not confound assessment. Apnoea testing assesses ventilatory drive, and is performed by:
	* Preoxygenating with 100% O~2~
	* Ventilator disconnection\
	Hypoxia (SpO~2~ <88%) should be avoided; attach a self-inflating bag with a PEEP valve to prevent atelectasis and provide some passive entrainment.
	* No respiratory effort when:
		* PaCO~2~ is ≥60mmHg, OR\
		Expect PaCO~2~ to ↑ by ~3mmHg/min as a guide for when to perform the ABG.
		* PaCO~2~ has risen 20mmHg above baseline

:::column-margin
Use of suction catheter or t-piece to provide passive oxygenation during apnoea testing is not recommended.\
\
For patients on ECMO during apnoea testing:

* Preoxygenate via the lung and circuit
* ↑ PaCO~2~ to >45mmHg on the circuit
* Attach a CPAP circuit as describe above
* ↓ Sweep to 0.5-1L/min
:::


### Spinal Reflexes

Spinal reflexes are movements due to loss of higher centre inhibition of a reflex arc, are **compatible with brain death** and:

* Occur:
	* In up to 50% of patients
	* Usually within 24 hours of death, though can stretch to days
	* Consistently\
	May be highly variable between patients, but usually repeatable within a given patient.
* Include:
	* Upper limb extension-pronation
	* Lower limb flexion
	* Deep tendon reflexes
	* Lazarus sign\
	Bilateral arm flexion, shoulder adduction, hand raising above chest.
	* Plantar response

## Investigations

Cerebral perfusion imaging is used when brain death cannot be determined because the ***preconditions* are not met**. Key investigations:

* 4-vessel angiogram\
Demonstrating absence of flow above the carotid siphon in the anterior circulation and foramen magnum in the posterior circulation.
* Tc-99 HMPAO Spect\
Lack of perfusion in the brain parenchyma.
* CT Angiography\
Acceptable when formal angiography or radionuclide imaging is not available.


:::column-margin
MRI and transcranial doppler should not be used to determine brain death, although doppler may be appropriate to **time** formal imaging.
:::

## Management

Good supportive care improves organ function in brain dead patients proceeding to organ donation. In addition to regular ICU supportive care, specific management includes:

* B
	* Lung protective ventilation
	* Routine respiratory care
* C
	* Autonomic storm\
	Short acting antihypertensives and β-blockers.
	* Autonomic collapse
		* Volume resuscitation\
		* Vasoactives\
		Bradycardia usually resistant to anticholinergics, so adrenergic vasoactives and vasopressin are preferred.
* E
	* External warming
	* Tri-iodothyronine\
	4μg bolus, then 3μg/hr given for haemodynamic instability with impaired cardiac function.
* F
	* Electrolyte correction\
	Minimise arrhythmia.
	* IVT\
	Aim to prevent DI and fluid overload, with UO 0.5-3mL/kg/hr targeted.
	* Desmopressin\
	4-8μg given if DI occurs. Can be repeated if polyuric.
* H
	* Anaemia correction
	* Coagulopathy correction
