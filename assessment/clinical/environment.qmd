# Surroundings

The ICU environment provides several clues to diagnosis and severity of illness. Key regions include:

* Bedspace
* Monitor
* Ventilator
* Infusions
* Ancillary equipment
* Drains
	* Surgical
	* IDC
	* NG
	* Faecal management system


## Bedspace

* Isolation room
	* Positive pressure
	* Negative pressure
* Infection control and PPE
* Waste disposal
	* Cytotoxic
* Room temperature\
Burns.
* Medications
	* Antibiotics\
	Implications for causative organism or resistance patterns. 
	* Pathognomonic medications
* Long-stay
	* Photographs/art
	* Physical therapy equipment
	* Activity plans
* Equipment
	* Wheelchair
	* Walking aids
	* Handweights
	* Splints
	* Cooling blanket


## Monitor

* **ECG**\
Rate and rhythm.
	* HR <30-35 may lead to critical coronary hypoperfusion, independent of blood pressure
* **Pressure monitoring**\
	* Alignment to haemodynamic supports
	* MAP <35mmHg (+/- 10mmHg) is usually the critical threshold for coronary perfusion, below which heart rate and cardiac output fall rapidly
* **EtCO~2~**
	* Level
	* Trace
	* PaCO~2~ gradient and dead space
* **Temperature**
* **ICP**\
If transduced from EVD, ensure monitor is leveled appropriately.


### Patterns

| Type of Shock                | MAP | CVP | CO/CI | MPAP  | PCWP |

Information from the monitor, ventilator, and medications should be integrated.\
\
e.g. "The SpO~2~ is 93% with an FiO~2~ of 50% - there is evidence of a raised A-a gradient".\
\
Or, "The patient is in AF, I note the heparin infusion and wonder if this is the sole indication for anticoagulation."
:::

* Cushing Triad\
↑ ICP leads to a sympathetic surge aimed to maintain cerebral perfusion, which manifests as:
	* Arterial hypertension
	* Bradycardia
	* Irregular respiration


## Ventilator

* Mode
* Oxygenation
	* FiO~2~
	* PEEP
	* Quick assessment of A-a gradient based on SpO~2~ and FiO~2~
* Ventilation
	* Minute ventilation
	* Dynamic compliance
	* Consider assessing plateau pressure if evidence of reduced compliance.
* Disease-specific ventilation strategies
* "Extubatable settings?"
* Airway suction

:::column-margin
Secretion appearance is an unreliable diagnostic tool, however secretions that are:

* Yellow, brown, or putrid\
Suggests bacterial infection of the lower airways or parenchyma.
* Foul-smelling yellow or dark-green\
Suggest lung abscesses or bronchiectasis.
* Colour does not accurately predict the causative organism
:::


## Infusions

* IV fluid
* Vasoactives
* Heparin
* Pathognomonic drugs
	* Octreotide/terlipressin
	* Hypertonic saline
	* Hypertonic dextrose
	* Nimodipine
	* Mannitol
	* IVIG
* TPN
* Blood


## Ancillary Equipment

* CRRT\
	* Mode
	* Dialysate/buffer
	* Dose
	* Anticoagulation
* Active cooling
* IABP


## Drains

### Chest Drains

* Location
	* Pleural
	* Mediastinal
* Size
* Output
	* Blood
	* Serous
* Behaviour
	* Swinging
	* Bubbling


### Abdominal Drains

* Location
* Size
* Output
	* Blood
	* Serous
		* Turbidity
	* Bile
	* Faeculent

### Urine

:::tick
Many abnormalities of urine colour are also visible in RRT effluent.
:::

* Quantity
* Colour
	* Concentrated
	May indicate:
		* Hypoperfusion or hypovolaemia\
		Classically low-volume.
		* Hyperbilirubinaemia
		* Haemolysis
		* Haematuria
		* Drugs
	* **Urobilinogen**\
	Dark and foamy urine secondary to hyperbilirubinaemia.

Small volumes of light urine are concerning for obstruction.

### Nasogastric

* Brown aspirates\
Commonly occur with small bowel ileus or obstruction.
* Feculent aspirates\
Indicate lower intestinal obstruction or severe ileus.
* Bilious aspirates\
Exclude upper GI haemorrhage.
* Pure nasogastric feed aspirates\
Indicate gastroparesis.

### Stool

* Faecal management system
	* Stool colour
		* Acholic stool indicates biliary obstruction due to lack of stercobilin
		* Haematochezia
		* Melania\
		Black, tarry, malodorous stool.
			* Indicates recent (4-20 hours) upper GI, small bowel, or caecal haemorrhage
			* Typically becomes bloodier the more distal the bleeding source
