# Surroundings

The ICU environment provides several clues to diagnosis and severity of illness. Key regions include:

* Bedspace
* Monitor
* Ventilator
* Infusions
* Lines and drains
	* IDC
	* NG
	* Faecal management system
	* Surgical
* Ancillary equipment



## Bedspace

* Isolation room
	* Positive pressure
	* Negative pressure
* Infection control and PPE
* Waste disposal
	* Cytotoxic
* Room temperature\
Burns.
* Medications
	* Antibiotics\
	Implications for causative organism or resistance patterns. 
	* Pathognomonic medications
* Long-stay
	* Photographs/art
	* Physical therapy equipment
	* Activity plans
* Equipment
	* Wheelchair
	* Walking aids
	* Handweights
	* Splints
	* Cooling blanket


## Monitor

* **ECG**\
Rate and rhythm.
	* HR <30-35 may lead to critical coronary hypoperfusion, independent of blood pressure
* **Pressure monitoring**\
	* Alignment to haemodynamic supports
	* MAP <35mmHg (+/- 10mmHg) is usually the critical threshold for coronary perfusion, below which heart rate and cardiac output fall rapidly
* **EtCO~2~**
	* Level
	* Trace
	* PaCO~2~ gradient and dead space
* **Temperature**
* **ICP**\
If transduced from EVD, ensure monitor is leveled appropriately.

Information from the monitor, ventilator, and medications should be integrated.\
\
e.g. "The SpO~2~ is 93% with an FiO~2~ of 50% - there is evidence of a raised A-a gradient".\
\
Or, "The patient is in AF, I note the heparin infusion and wonder if this is the sole indication for anticoagulation."
:::

* Cushing Triad\
↑ ICP leads to a sympathetic surge aimed to maintain cerebral perfusion, which manifests as:
	* Arterial hypertension
	* Bradycardia
	* Irregular respiration


## Ventilator

* Mode
* Oxygenation
	* **FiO~2~**
	* **PEEP**
	* Quick assessment of A-a gradient based on SpO~2~ and FiO~2~
* Ventilation
	* Minute ventilation
	* **Dynamic compliance**
		* **Peak pressure**
		* **Plateau pressure**
	* Consider assessing plateau pressure to determine static compliance if dynamic compliance is ↓
* Disease-specific ventilation strategies
* "Extubatable settings?"
* Airway suction
	* Yellow, brown, green, or creamy\
	Infection.
	* Foamy or foamy-bloody\
	Pulmonary oedema.
	* Bloody\
	Tracheal suction trauma or haemorrhage.
	* Brown\
	Enteral nutrition or infection.


:::column-margin
The colour of purulent secretions does not accurately predict the causative organism. However, *in general*, secretions that are:

* Yellow, brown, or putrid\
Suggests bacterial infection of the lower airways or parenchyma.
* Foul-smelling and yellow or dark-green\
Suggests lung abscesses or bronchiectasis.
:::


## Infusions

* IV fluid
* Vasoactives
* Heparin
* Pathognomonic drugs
	* Octreotide/terlipressin
	* Hypertonic saline
	* Hypertonic dextrose
	* Nimodipine
	* Mannitol
	* IVIG
* TPN
* Blood


## Drains

### Urine

:::tick
Many abnormalities of urine colour are also visible in RRT effluent.
:::

* Quantity
* Colour
	* Clear
		* Polyuria
			* Diabetes insipidus
			* Hyperglycaemia
			* Diuretic therapy
	* Concentrated
	May indicate:

		Classically low-volume.
	* Turbid/purulent\
	**Pyuria** suggesting infection.
	* Sediment
		* UTI
		* AKI
		* Presence of IDC
	* Foamy
