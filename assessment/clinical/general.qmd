## Features

### Vital Signs

* Respiratory rate
	* Tachypnoea is a sensitive but non-specific marker of severity
	* Persistently normal respiratory rate ↓ likelihood of some severe pathologies
		* Shock
		* PE
* **Heart rate**
	* Tachycardia is non-specific, but suggests ↑ sympathetic tone
	* Absence of tachycardia significantly ↓ likelihood of hypovolaemia, heart failure, and shock\
	Key exceptions include:
		* Intraperitoneal haemorrhage may result in vagal stimulation, and lead to normal or ↓↓ HR
	* **Sinus arrhythmia**\
	Describes an ↑ HR during inspiration and ↓ HR during expiration, common in children and athletes.
* **Blood pressure**
	* Clinical assessment of blood pressure by palpation is unreliable
	* Qualitative assessment can be made through the velocity of blood flow following an arterial puncture during arterial line insertion
\
* **Shock index**\
Ratio between heart rate and SBP. Interpretation:
	* 0.5-0.7: Normal
	* \>1: ↑ Likelihood of macro-haemodynamic compromise

:::column-margin
$Shock \ Index = {Heart \ Rate \over Systolic \ Blood \ Pressure}$
:::


### Respiratory

* **Cheyne-Stokes** respiration
	* Alternating episodes hyperpnoea followed by apnoeic spells
		* Apnoea may last up to 45s, but is usualy 5-10s
	* Generally indicative of ***acute* cerebral** or ***chronic* cardiac** pathology
	* Physiologic in infants and at high altitude

:::column-margin
![Cheyne-Stokes Respiration](/resources/cheyne_stokes.png)
:::

* **Biot breathing**\
Similar to Cheyne-Stokes, but abrupt alteration between apnoea and hyperpnoea and less regular intervals.
	* Indicative of pontine or brainstem injury

:::column-margin
Abdominal motion indirectly indicates the function of the diaphragm.
:::

* **Apneustic breathing**\
Irregular respiration rate and tidal volume, classically with an **end-inspiratory hold** prior to commencing the next breath.
\
* **Paradoxical** breathing\
Inward movement of the chest while the abdomen raises during inspiration, which occurs in:
	* Upper airway obstruction
	* Severe respiratory distress
	* Diaphragmatic dysfunction
\
* **Obstructive** breathing\
Expiratory airflow limitation may lead to:
	* Active abdominal contraction during expiration
	* Slow and incomplete descent of the chest
	* Pursed-lip expiration\
	Generation of auto-PEEP, maintaining opening of small airways.
	* E-time > I-time
\
* **Restrictive** breathing\
Prolonged, forceful inspiration due to inspiratory airflow limitation.

:::column-margin
Obstructive and restrictive breathing can occur in the same patient.
:::

* **Trepopnoea**\
Dyspnoea occurring in one lateral position but not the other, signifying worse disease in the non-dependent lung which occurs due to poorer V/Q matching when the diseased lung is in the dependent position.
\


### Cardiovascular

* **Orthopnoea**\
Dyspnoea relieved in the sitting or standing position, due to a ↓ in VR and pulmonary venous congestion.

:::column-margin
Inability to lie flat is a significant marker of severe RV failure, tamponade, or impending airway obstruction.
:::

* **Platypnoea**\
Dyspnoea relieved by recumbency, generally due to intracardiac (right-to-left) or intrapulmonary shunts that are worsened due to the ↓ in West Zone 3 that occurs in the upright position.

* **Centralisation**\
Re-distribution of central blood volume away from the peripheries, leading to:
	* Extensive mottling
	* Diaphoresis
	* Piloerection
	* Cold skin
	* Loss of peripheral pulses
	* Confusion secondary to cerebral hypoperfusion

:::column-margin
![Centralisation](/resources/centralisation.png)
:::

* **Peripheral perfusion**\
↓ Peripheral blood flow occurs early in most shock states, leading to ↓ capillary refill and temperature. Caveats include:
	* Feet are typically affected earlier than hands
	* Localised hypo-perfusion
		* Vaso-occlusive disease
		* Embolism
	* Environmental temperature\
	Central capillary refill is less affected by environmental conditions but is prolonged only in severe hypoperfusion; consequently it is much more specific although less sensitive.
\
* **Livedo reticularis**\
**Lace-like mottling** of the skin occurring due to **hypoxaemia** in vessels **along** the **watershed margins** between regions supplied by different ascending arterioles. May occur due to:
	* Vasospasm
	* Thrombosis
	* Hyperviscosity

:::column-margin
![Livedo reticularis](/resources/livedo.jpeg)
:::

* **Pitting oedema**\
Pitting oedema occurs due to extravasation of fluid into the interstitium. In general:
	* Subjective puffy fingers is the earliest sign
	* Clinical detection requires a 2-3L ↑ in extracellular fluid volume
	* Cardiac oedema is:
		* Symmetrical
		* Generalised
		* Dependent
			* Ankles and legs in ambulant patient
			* Sacrum and thighs in bedridden patient
	* Generalised oedema:
		* Occurs with capillary leak associated with severe illness
		* May occur at the trunk before spreading peripherally

:::column-margin
![Pitting Oedema](/resources/pitting.jpg)
:::


### Gastrointestinal

* **Foetor hepaticus**\
Smell of rotten eggs and garlic on the breath due to dimethyl sulphide accumulation, indicating portosystemic shunting.
