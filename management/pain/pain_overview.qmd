# Pain


Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage. Pain is:

* Distinct from nociception\
Process of nervous system transmission of a noxious stimuli.
* Divided into:
	* Acute pain
	* Chronic pain\
	Pain lasting beyond the time expected for healing following an injury, occurring due to changes in both peripheral and central nervous systems, as well as psychologically.



## Pain Management

Pain management is important as pain:

* Causes suffering
* Limits rehabilitation\
Adequate analgesia facilitates **restoration** of **normal function**.
* Leads to secondary complications
	* Catecholamine release
		* ↑ MVO~2~\
		Ischaemia.
		* Fatigue
	* Stasis
		* Atelectasis/pneumonia
		* DVT
		* Catabolic state
	* Progresses to chronic pain



### Goals of Pain Management

Goals of pain management include:

* ↓ Pain initiation
* Inhibit neurotransmission
* Prevent sensitisation
	* Central
	* Peripheral
* Psychological preparation
	* Set expectations
	* Control pain


## Pain Assessment

> Use the **PASS** assessment:
>* Pain history
>	* Somatic
>	* Neuropathic
>* Analgesia and other drug substances
>* Stress and other psychology
>* Surgical factors and biological causes


Key components of a pain history include:

* Site
	* Location
	* Radiation
* Circumstances\
Associated trauma, procedures.
* Character\
Key descriptors.
* Intensity\
Including:
	* At rest
	* With movement
	* Temporal factors
		* Duration
		* Intensity over time
		* Continuous or intermittent
	* Aggravating or relieving factors
* Associated symptoms
* Effect of pain on:
	* Activities of daily living
	* Sleep
* Treatment
	* Current and previous medications
		* Doses
		* Frequency of use
		* Efficacy
		* Adverse effects
	* Other treatment
	* Health professionals consulted
* Relevant medical history
* Factors influencing patients symptomatic treatment
	* Belief around cause
	* Knowledge, expectations, and preferences for management
	* Expected outcome
	* Reduction in pain required for patient satisfaction
	* Coping responses
	* Family expectations



## Mechanism Based Approach

>* Key terms:
>	* Preventative analgesia\
>	Analgesic effect lasts longer than expected duration of drug effet.
>	* Preemptive analgesia\
>	Analgesia provided prior to nociceptive stimulus.
>* Aim to target:
>	* Somatic pain
>	* Visceral pain
>	* Neuropathic pain

* [Paracetamol](pmol)
* [NSAIDS](NSAID)
* [Opioids](opioids)
* [Intrathecal Opioids](itopioid)
* [Intrathecal Adjuncts](itadjunct)
* [Epidural Analgesia](epidural)
* [Paravertebral](pvb)
* [Analgesic Adjuncts](adj)
* [Other](other)



### Paracetamol{#pmol}

* Paracetamol given pre- and intraoperatively reduces PONV and improves analgesia, but does ont reduce opioids
* Reduces PONV when given IV\
Effect is independent of its reduction in opioid requirements.


### NSAIDs{#NSAID}

* Renal injury is low when used appropriately
* All NSAIDs sit on a spectrum of activity between COX-1 and COX-2
* Non-selective NSAIDs:
	* Are associated with ↑ risk of minor and major bleeding\
	* May precipitate bronchospasm in susceptible patients\
* COX-2 inhibitors **do not**:
	* Impair platelet function\
	Blood loss is reduced compared to non-selective NSAIDs and comparable to placebo after TKR.
	* Precipitate bronchospasm
	* Appear to ↑ rates of gastric ulceration when used in short courses (5-7 days)
	* Affect bone healing in humans
* Cardiac risk is:
	* Slightly greater with COX-2s
	* Appears dose-related
	* ↑ in patients without diagnosed cardiac disease
	* Naproxen and celecoxib have lower risks of myocardial injury than other NSAIDs


### Opioids{#opioids}

> Do not use long-acting opioids in high-risk patients


General opioids:

* Highly effective for somatic pain\
Act pre-synaptically and post-synaptically at multiple points.
* Poor control of visceral pain
* High doses can induce hyperalgesia\
Particularly remifentanil.
* Slow release opioids should not be used as sole agents in early acute pain
* Immediate-release opioids should be used for breakthrough pain
* Pruritus can be reduced using:
	* Naloxone
	* Naltrexone
	* Droperidol
* OIVI\
Particularly in high-risk groups.
	* Sedation\
	Sedation is a better predictor of ventilatory impairment than respiratory rate.
	* ↓ Oropharyngeal tone
	* Elevated CO~2~ set point
* Opioid use ↑ risk of falls and impairs driving


Addiction and divergence:

* Short-term opioid therapy may lead to long term use
* Many patients who retain unused opioid tablets are willing to share them with others
* The most common source of prescription opioids for non-medical use is a friend or relative
* Poorly managed acute pain may reduce retention in opioid-maintenance programs
* Methadone and buprenorphine maintenance should be continued throughout acute pain episodes wherever possible

Patches:

* Transdermal fentanyl patches should not be used in acute pain


PCAs:

* Improve analgesia\
Except where there are high nurse:patient ratios.
* Subcutaneous PCA is as effective as IV PCA
* Improve patient satisfaction
* ↑ opioid consumption


Methadone:

* Old, synthetic, and cheap
* Some NMDA affinity
* High interindividual pharmacokinetic variability
* Long half life of up to 60 hours\
May lead to prolonged respiratory depression in overdose.
* High dose may prolong QT interval\
TDP associated with chronic high dose, rather than single perioperative dosing.
* 0.2mg/kg (up to 20mg) at induction reduces PCA use by 48 hours in spinal surgery


Tramadol:

* Mixed receptor activity
* Relatively high NNT
* Effective in neuropathic pain
* Minimal improvement in pain score, but better subjective opinion of pain


Tapentadol:

* Similar efficacy to other opioids with a reduced rate of GIT side effects


Buprenorphine:

* Has a ceiling effect for the respiratory depression but not for the analgesia


### Intrathecal Opioid{#itopioid}

>* Lowest effective dose (usually 100-150µg; less than 300µg) should be used
>* Respiratory monitoring should occur for at least 18-24 hours following a single dose


* Intrathecal morphine and fentanyl prolong spinal anaesthetic block
* Morphine is the most commonly studied drug\
Typically 100-500µg used\
	* Generally higher doses used in cardiac or thoracic surgery
	* No benefit seen in exceeding 300µg
	* No strong-dose response relationship demonstrated in meta-analyses
* Quality of analgesia:
	* Similar to epidural for liver resection
	* Duration of ~18-24 hours
		* Reduction in morphine use may extend up to 48 hours
	* Prolongs duration of intrathecal anaesthesia
	* High degree of patient satisfaction, despite side effects
* Complications include:
	* Nausea/Vomiting
	* Pruritus\
	10-15%.
		* Amenable to subcutaneous naloxone
	* Urinary retention
	* Respiratory depression\
		* May be:
			* Hypoxic or hypercapnoeic with an normal respiratory rate
			* ↓ respiratory rate with normal gases
			* **Pupil size** does not correlate with degree of respiratory depression
		* Typically biphasic\
		Second peak is delayed, occurring at 8-12 hours.
		* NNH 15-84\
		More common compared to PCA.


### Intrathecal Adjuncts{#itadjunct}

* Intrathecal clonidine improves duration of analgesia and anaesthesia
* Intrathecal adrenaline improves duration of analgesia and anaesthesia when used with local anaesthetics



### Epidural Analgesia{#epidural}

Overview:

* Provides better analgesia than system opioids, irrespective of patient or surgery type\
Provides ~ 1/10 reduction in pain over the first 24 hours postoperatively.
* Reduces:
	* Respiratory failure\
	After major surgery in high risk patients; NNT 15.
	* MI risk.
	* Muscle catabolism and subsequent hyperglycaemia
	* Duration of postoperative ileus post-bowel surgery
	* Need for ventilation in rib fractures
	* Incidence of pneumonia and mortality
* Safe
	* Epidural haematoma is vanishingly rare\
		* Anticoagulation and coagulopathy are the two most important risk factors
		* Decompression within 8 hours of symptom onset ↑ likelihood of partial or good neurological recovery
	* Epidural abscesses\
	Most likely to track from skin: significantly reduced with chlorhexidine-impregnated dressings. 
* Complications
	* Those relating to insertion and management of any epidural
	* Hypotension
		* May require HDU monitoring/vasopressors
		* Better corrected with vasopressors than volume\
		Vasopressors demonstrated to more likely improve GI blood flow than excessive fluid.


Implementation:

* Can be used as a sole technique\
E.g. epidural top-up for LUSCS.
* Can be used as an adjunct to general anaesthesia
	* May be used for either thoracic or abdominal operations
	* Epidural should be sited depending on surgical site
		* Middle of the surgical incision for low-thoracic epidurals
		* Relatively more cranially (i.e. top half) of the incision for high-thoracic epidurals\
		Higher sites of insertion exhibit less cranial spread of epidurally administered LA.
* Use of high concentration (e.g. 0.75% bupivacaine) leads to a rapid onset of sensory and motor blockade\
Motor blockade provides muscle relaxation, ↓ the requirement to administer NMBD.
	* 3-5ml of 0.75% bupivacaine can be used for top-up


### Paravertebral{#pvb}

Paravertebral block:

* Superior analgesia in breast surgery compared to systemic analgesia
* Comparable analgesia but improved side-effect profile compared to epidural analgesia for thoracics


### Analgesic Adjuncts{#adj}

α2-delta ligands:

* α2-delta ligands\
Probably little effect in most patients, but good in opioid tolerant.
* Avoid using PRN
* Gabapentin and pregabalin are opioid-sparing
* Gabapentin reduces phantom limb pain


Clonidine:

* Useful in opioid users


Ketamine:

* Preventive analgesic effect
* Opioid sparing
* Reduces opioid hyperalgesia
* Does not ↑ ICP or reduce CPP
* Reduces chronic post-surgical pain
* Reduces PONV\
In thoracics.
* May be useful in opioid-resistant pain
* Reduces phantom limb pain


Lignocaine:

* Perioperative IV lignocaine reduces:
	* Pain
	* Opioid requirement
	* PONV
	* Ileus duration
	* Hospital stay


Antidepressants:

* TCA and SNRIs are effective analgesics in chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia
* Duloxetine may be effective in chronic low back pain



### Other{#other}

Nitrous oxide:

* Has analgesic efficacy in labour
	* ↑ maternal satisfaction
* Neuropathy and bone marrow suppression are rare but potentially serious complications of nitrous oxide use\
Consideration should be given to duration of exposure and supplementation with vitamin B~12~.


Dexamethasone:

* Reduces post-operative pain, as well as PONV and fatigue
* May cause mild hyperglycaemia
* Prolongs duration of sensory and motor block\
Extent is similar when given in the block as to when given systemically.


**Other**:

* Avoid withdrawal of benzodiazepines in acute pain
* Calcitonin reduces acute (not chronic) phantom limb pain
* No evidence supporting use of cannabinoids
