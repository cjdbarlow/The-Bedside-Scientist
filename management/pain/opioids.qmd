# Opioids {#sec-opioids}

:::caution
Avoid long-acting opioids in high-risk patients

This section covers IV and PO opioids for analgesia. Harms of opioid medication are discussed separately under @sec-opioid_harm. Intrathecal administration of opioids are covered under @sec-intrathecal.
:::

General opioids:

* Highly effective for somatic pain\
Act pre-synaptically and post-synaptically at multiple points.
* Poor control of visceral pain
* High doses can induce hyperalgesia\
Particularly remifentanil.
* Slow release opioids should not be used as sole agents in early acute pain
* Immediate-release opioids should be used for breakthrough pain
* Pruritus can be reduced using:
	* Naloxone
	* Naltrexone
	* Droperidol
* OIVI\
Particularly in high-risk groups.
	* Sedation\
	Sedation is a better predictor of ventilatory impairment than respiratory rate.
	* ↓ Oropharyngeal tone
	* Elevated CO~2~ set point
* Opioid use ↑ risk of falls and impairs driving


Addiction and divergence:

* Short-term opioid therapy may lead to long term use
* Many patients who retain unused opioid tablets are willing to share them with others
* The most common source of prescription opioids for non-medical use is a friend or relative
* Poorly managed acute pain may reduce retention in opioid-maintenance programs
* Methadone and buprenorphine maintenance should be continued throughout acute pain episodes wherever possible


Patches:

* Transdermal fentanyl patches should not be used in acute pain


PCAs:

* Improve analgesia\
Except where there are high nurse:patient ratios.
* Subcutaneous PCA is as effective as IV PCA
* Improve patient satisfaction
* ↑ opioid consumption


Methadone:

* Old, synthetic, and cheap
* Some NMDA affinity
* High interindividual pharmacokinetic variability
* Long half life of up to 60 hours\
May lead to prolonged respiratory depression in overdose.
* High dose may prolong QT interval\
TDP associated with chronic high dose, rather than single perioperative dosing.
* 0.2mg/kg (up to 20mg) at induction reduces PCA use by 48 hours in spinal surgery


Tramadol:

* Mixed receptor activity
* Relatively high NNT
* Effective in neuropathic pain
* Minimal improvement in pain score, but better subjective opinion of pain


Tapentadol:

* Similar efficacy to other opioids with a reduced rate of GIT side effects


Buprenorphine:

* Has a ceiling effect for the respiratory depression but not for the analgesia
