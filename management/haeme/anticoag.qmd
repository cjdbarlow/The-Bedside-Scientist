# Anticoagulation {#sec-anticoag}

Therapeutic anticoagulation has a broad array of both:

:::column-margin
This provides a general overview of therapeutic anticoagulation. Management of perioperative anticoagulation is covered @sec-periop_anticoag, and thromboprophylaxis is covered under @sec-thromboprophylaxis.
:::

* Indications
* Therapeutic options
	* Parenteral
		* Intravenous UFH
		* Low-molecular weight heparins
	* Oral
		* Vitamin K Antagonists
		* Direct Anticoagulants


## Indications

## Contraindications

## Options

### Unfractionated Heparin

Unfractionated heparin:

* Has a number of mechanisms of action
	* Potentiates antithrombin III
	* Neutralises thrombin
	* Neutralises Factor Xa
* Detectable through ↑ APTT or anti-Xa


**Key** pharmacological **properties**:


**Reversal**:

* Cessation
	* Safe
	* Relatively rapid
* Protamine

:::column-margin
**Protamine is** an **anticoagulant** in excess doses.
:::

### Low Molecular Weight Heparin

**Reversal**:

* Cessation
* Protamine\
Reverses ~50% of total effect.


### Vitamin K Antagonists

Vitamin K antagonists:

* Are functionally synonymous with the various flavours of warfarin
* Prevent synthesis of vitamin K dependent clotting factors
* Detectable though ↑ PT and INR.

:::column-margin
Vitamin K dependent clotting factors include:

* Factor II
* Factor VII
* Factor IX
* Factor X
:::


**Key** pharmacological **properties**:

* Highly inter- and intra-individual variability
* Monitoring required\
Frequency varies depending on stability and compliance.
* 


**Reversal**:

* Factor replacement\
	* Indicated for rapid and complete reversal
	* Consumption of administered factors will result in anticoagulation\
	Synthesis remains inhibited.
	* Options include:
		* 4-factor PCC
		* 3-factor PCC\
		May still require FFP.
		* FFP
* Vitamin K
	* Acts within ~6 hours
	* Sustained reversal\
	Balanced against thrombotic risk.
	* High doses may cause significant warfarin resistance if it is recommenced


### Direct Anticoagulants

Direct anticoagulants inhibit specific elements of the clotting cascade, either:

* Factor Xa
	* Rivaro**xa**ban
	* Api**xa**ban
	* Edo**xa**ban
* Thrombin
	* Dabigatran


**Key** pharmacological **properties**:

:::column-margin
DOAC may be preferable to VKA for both VTE and stroke prevention in AF.
:::

* Are 60-80% renally cleared
* Hepatic metabolism is via CYP450 enzymes
* Elimination half-life of 7-12 hours
* Have fixed dosing
* Do not require monitoring
	* ↑ Therapeutic time compared to VKA
	* ↓ ICH risk compared to VKA


**Monitoring**:

* Monitoring of anticoagulant effect is more difficult compared to VKA
* Coagulation assays **qualitatively assess** the **presence** of a **coagulation effect**, but not the degree
	* ↑ APTT and ↑ TT occurs with thrombin inhibition\
	i.e. Dabigatran.
	* ↑ PT occurs with Factor Xa inhibition\
	Requires an appropriate DOAC-sensitive reagent.
* Specific drug assays are available, although drug levels corresponding to therapeutic anticoagulation are not widely available


**Reversal**:

* Reversal options are limited
* Dabigatran
	* Idrarucizumab 5g
		* Monoclonal antibody
		* Rapidly effective
	* Dialysis\
	Limited efficacy, 2^nd^ line to idrarucizumab.
* Xa inhibitors
	* Andexanaet alfa
		* Recombinant factor Xa
		* Binds to rivaroxaban, apixaban, and enoxaparin
