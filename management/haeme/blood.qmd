# Transfusion Overview {#sec-transfusion}

The covers:

* The process of blood typing
* Blood products

## Blood Typing

Blood typing is matching donated products to the donor, and is done to balance the:

:::column-margin
A Brief Refresher on Blood Types:

* RBC may express either type A, type B, both, or no antigen
* The blood group refers to what antigen your RBC express\
The O blood group express no antigen on the RBC.
* Plasma contains IgM antibody to non-expressed antigens\
These are developed within 3-6 months of birth.
* Therefore, the following can be given to anyone with risk of *ABO* incompatibility:
	* Type O *RBC*, as they **express** no antigen\
	Thus, type O are referred to as the universal donor.
	* Type AB *plasma*, as it **contains** no antibody\
	Type AB have unjustly been referred to as the universal recipient, which is only true in an erythro-centric model of the universe.
:::

* Risk of haemolytic transfusion reactions
* Urgency of required transfusion
* Allocation of scare resources


Blood products can be divided based on the degree of typing required:

* **Untyped**\
Immediately available. Use of untyped blood:
	* Consumes limited pool of universal units
	* Is justified in patients needing emergency transfusion
	* Is not justified in patients stable enough to wait until crossmatching is complete
	* Has a higher risk of transfusion reaction\
	Risk is from minor antibodies.
		* Present in **2% of population**\
		Prevalence **↑ with age**.
		* Typically IgG mediated
		* Does not generally cause major haemolysis\
		Overall **haemolysis rate of emergency transfusion is 0.1%**.
	* For **packed red cells** is **O-**
		* Rh- (or unknown) females of childbearing age should receive O-\
		Risk of rhesus disease if Rh+ blood given.
			* If prolonged/repeated transfusion required, use of Rh+ blood can be justified due to limited availability of Rh- blood
	* For **plasma** is usually **AB+**, but can be A+ with **low anti-B**\
	Justified due to:
		* Very limited supply of AB+ plasma
		* Low risk of significant reactions in B patients receiving incompatible group A plasma:
			* Low overall presence of AB+ and B+ individuals
			* Dilution of recipient group B RBCs with untyped
			* Low risk of significant reaction in B patients 

:::column-margin
Each subsequent stage results in a significantly smaller ↓ in the absolute risk of incompatibility - the greatest gains are had with blood grouping and typing.
:::

* **Group-specific uncrossmatched**\
	* Prevents ABO reaction
	* 99.8% chance of compatibility
	* Rhesus-matching is mandatory in children and women of childbearing potential\
	Prevent maternal antibody causing foetal haemolysis and subsequent miscarriage/death of an Rh+ foetus.
	* Generally available within 5-10 minutes\
\
* **Group-specific partial crossmatch**
	* 99.94% chance of compatibility\
\
* **Group-specific fully crossmatched**
	* 99.95% chance of compatibility
	* Generally available in 30-45 minutes


### Typing Process

Testing a recipient and preparing donor blood for transfusion involves **three stages**:

1. **Blood group** (ABO and Rhesus) typing\
Takes ~15 minutes.
	* Forward gropuing\
	Patient RBC mixed with anti-A and anti-B antibodies; agglutination indicates antigen presence.
	* Reverse grouping\
	Patient plasma mixed with known type A or type B RBC; agglutination indicates antibody presence.
	* Forward and reverse grouping tests must agree to confirm an ABO  grouping\
	Divergence indicate:
		* Recent incompatible transfusion
		* Foetomaternal haemorrhage
		* Presence of a strange antibody.
	* Rhesus typing performed with known anti-D serum.
2. **Antibody screen**\
Screening for minor antibodies other than anti-A and anti-B.
3. **Crossmatching**\
Testing of patients blood with a *particular* donated sample to make sure they are compatible.
	* Detects:
		* ABO incompatibility\
		Should be determined by the previous round of testing.
		* Minor antibody presence
	* Speed depends on the antibody screen:
		* A computer cross-match can typically match a unit of blood in <5 minutes, if the minor antibody screen is normal
		* An abnormal minor antibody screen requires a prolonged (usually manual) cross-match, which may take **45 minutes to** several **hours**

## Blood Products

Include:

* Fractionated products
	* Packed cells\
	Requires crossmatch.
	* Factors
		* Fresh frozen plasma
		* Factor concentrates
		* Cryoprecipitate
		* Fibrinogen concentrate
	* Platelets
	* Granulocytes
* Whole blood

### Packed Cells

Donor blood is cytapheresed to produce cells and a small volume of carrier plasma. PRBC:

* 1 unit ≈ 200-300mL\
Generally raises Hb by ~10g/dL.
* Are not fully functional\
Develop **storage lesions** after donation, rendering them progressively less effective:
	* ↓ O~2~ offloading at tissues which impedes oxygen extraction
	* ↓ Cell deformability\
	↓ ATP reduces cell membrane maintenance, resulting in loss of biconcave disc shape. This causes:
		* ↓ Microvascular flow
		* ↓ Functional capillary density
	* ↑ Fragility\
	↑ Risk of haemolysis and reticuloendothelial destruction.
		* Conjugated bilirubinaemia
		* Accumulation of metabolic products
	* ↑ Neutrophil activation
* Are generally routinely **leukcoreduced**\
Removal of granulocytes and leukocytes prior to storage which:
	* ↓ Transfusion reactions\
	TRALI, febrile reactions, CMV infection, transfusion-associated GvHD, alloimmunisation.
	* ↓ Storage lesions
* Transfusion should:
	* Begin once removed from refrigerator
	* Complete within 4 hours of removal
	* Returned to controlled storage within 30 minutes of removal (if not transfused)
	* Cannot be returned if out of controlled storage for >30 minutes

:::

* 1 unit ≈ 200-300 ml\
Contains normal levels of clotting factors, albumin, and immunoglobulin:
	* ~0.5g of fibrinogen
	* 0.7 IU/mL of Factor VIKI
* Dose is usually 10-15ml/kg\
This is a substantial volume for a normovolaemic patient - consider factor concentrates.
* Stored at -18°C to prevent clotting factor degradation\
Must be thawed prior to administration.
* ABO compatibility highly desirable but not essential
	* Low-titre anti-A and anti-B are preferable when transfusing ABO incompatible plasma
* Transfusion should:
	* Commence within 30 minutes
	* Be completed within 4 hours of thawing
	* Cannot be returned after 30 minutes out of controlled storage
		* Cannot be re-frozen
		* If returned within 30 minutes, it can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours at 2-6°C and re-issued

:::column-margin
FFP should not be used as a volume expander for hypovolaemia in absence of an appropriate indication.
:::

### Prothrombin Complex Concentrates

Freeze-dried preparation from donor plasma that:

:::column-margin
3-factor PCC is also known as factor IX complex.
:::

* Contains the vitamin-K dependent clotting factors
	* Factor II
	* Factor VII\
	Not present in all preparations; so these are usually described as either:
		* 4-factor PCC\
		Contain all factors.
		* 3-factor PCC\
		Contain II, IX, and X.
	* Factor IX
	* Factor X
* Indicated for:
	* Correction of vitamin K antagonism
	* Correction of coagulopathy in absence of hypovolaemia

:::column-margin
I find PCC useful in the operating room for *rapidly* correcting coagulopathy, as it can be given far more quickly than an equivalent factor-load of FFP.
:::

### Single-Factor Concentrates

Donor plasma isolated or recombinant production of concentrated:

* AT III\
Treatment of heparin resistance:
	* For CPB: 1000-2000 units if inadequate ACT after >600 U/kg of UFH
* Activated factor VII
* Factor VIII
	* Heat treated to inactivate HIV
	* For treatment of haemophilia A
* Factor IX


### Cryoprecipitate

FFP derivative which:

:::column-margin
Manufactured by freezing and then thawing FFP, collecting the precipitate, and then re-suspending it in plasma.
:::

* May be presented as:
	* Single donor\
	30-40mL.
	* Apheresis\
	~50mL.
* Stored at -18°C
* Contains concentrated:
	* **Fibrinogen**\
	Main advantage, as there is little fibrinogen in FFP.
	* Factor VIII
	* Factor XIII
	* Fibronectin
	* vWF
* Transfusion should:
	* Commence within 30 minutes
	* Be completed within 4 hours
	* Cannot be returned after 30 minutes out of controlled storage


### Fibrinogen Concentrate

Freeze-dried human plasma:

* Contains ~1g of fibrinogen
* Reconstituted with water
* Used in massive transfusion


### Platelets

* 1 unit ≈ 50mL\
Generally raises platelet count by ~10× 10^9^/L.
* Usually come in 4-unit bags
* ABO match preferable but not essential
	* Apheresis platelets have a lower titre of anti-A and anti-B and have a lower risk of haemolysis
* Stored at 20-24°C with constant agitation
* Transfusion should:
	* Commence as soon as received
	* Completed within 1 hour of issue
	* *May* be able to be returned after 1 hour, conditional on storage

The volume of incompatible plasma administered with platelets is significantly higher (due to greater platelet volume), but because of greater limitations in platelet availability the higher risk is assumed necessary.
:::

### Granulocytes

Granulocyte (neutrophils) are harvested from the buffy coat and:

* Indicated for neutropenic sepsis
* Must be ABO and Rh compatible
* Irradiated prior to transfusion


### Whole Blood

Whole blood:

:::column-margin
1:1:1 mixtures of fractionated products do not faithfully reconstitute whole blood, but instead yeild a dilute mixture with:

* Haematocrit 29%
* Platelet count ~90× 10^9^/L
:::

* Has full haemostatic function\
Preferable to fractionated products for treatment of massive haemorrhage, when available.
* Has an ↑ complexity of type matching\
Options include:
	* Group-specific whole blood transfusion\
	Transfuse from donor with identical ABO group.
	* Low-titre type-O whole blood transfusion\
	From O donor with low anti-A or anti-B levels.
		* This ↑↑ complexity of determining the patients blood group
		* Group should be taken prior to administering low-titre whole blood
		* Standard of care in WWII, Korea, and Vietnam
* Collected from donors into citrated bags
	* Goal is generally ~450mL/585g
	* Bag should be agitated periodically to ↓ risk of clot formation
* Is divided into:
	* Fresh whole blood
		* Stored at room temperature and administered within 24 hours
		* Generally not tested for transfusion-transmitted diseases and so not appropriate for civilian use
		* Refrigerated within 8 hours and stored
	* Stored whole blood
		* Can be fully tested for transfusion-transmitted disease
		* Can be kept for:
			* 21 days in CPD (Citrate Phosphate Dextrose)
			* 35 days in CPDA-1 (Citrate-phosphate-dextrose adenine)


## Irradiation of Blood Products

Exposure of donated cellular products to high (25Gy) doses of ionised radiation:

* Destroys contained lymphocytes
	* ↓ Risk of transfusion-associated GvHD
* Does not make the blood radioactive, and is not otherwise damaging
	* Some units may routinely irradiate all cellular products
	* Is not required for non-cellular (e.g. plasma) products
* Is indicated for transfusion to patients who are:
	* Immunocompromised
		* Lymphoma
		* Stem-cell transplants
		* Aplastic anaemia
	* Related-donor transfusion
	* Granulocyte transfusions
	* HLA-matched platelets
	* Neonates


## Key Studies

**Red cell youth**:

* Historically, the oldest available cells have been used to avoid wastage
* Critically ill patients (who are more susceptible to storage lesions, and receive more blood transfusions) may benefit from receiving younger product
