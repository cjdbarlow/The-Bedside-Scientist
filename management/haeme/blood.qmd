# Transfusion and Blood Products {#sec-transfusion}


## Blood Typing

Involves:

* Blood group (ABO) typing\
Takes ~15 minutes.
* Antibody screen\
Screening for minor antibodies other than anti-A and anti-B. Takes up to **45** minutes.
	* **If** antibody screen is **normal**, computer cross-match can typically match unit of blood in <5 minutes

Typing balances risk (of transfusion reactions) against availability. Blood can be:

* Uncrossmatched\
Immediately available.
* Group-specific uncrossmatched blood\
	* 99.8% chance of compatibility
	* Generally available within 5-10 minutes
* Group-specific partial crossmatch
	* 99.94% chance of compatibility
* Group-specific fully crossmatched
	* 99.95% chance of compatibility
	* Generally available in 30-45 minutes


### Use of Uncrossmatched Blood

If transfusion is required **before ABO typing** is complete, uncrossmatched blood can be given. Using uncrossmatched blood:

* Consumes limited pool of universal units
* Has a higher risk of transfusion reaction\
Risk of reaction from minor antibodies.
	* Present in **2% of population**\
	Prevalence **↑ with age**.
	* Typically IgG mediated
	* Does not generally cause major haemolysis\
	Overall **haemolysis rate of emergency transfusion is 0.1%**.
* Type for **packed red cells** is **O-**
	* Rh- (or unknown) females of childbearing age shoul receive O-\
	Risk of rhesus disease if Rh+ blood given.
		* If prolonged/repeated transfusion required, use of Rh+ blood can be justified due to limited availability of Rh- blood
* Type for **plasma** is usually **AB+**, but can be A+ with **low anti-B**
	* Very limited supply of AB+ plasma
	* Use of A+ plasma with low anti-B plasma is epidemiologically justified\
		* Low risk due to low overall presence of AB+ and B+ individuals
		* Demonstrated to be safe
* Is justified in patients needing emergency transfusion, but not in those patients who are stable enough to wait until crossmatched units become available


## Blood Products

Include:

* Packed cells
* Fresh frozen plasma
* Cryoprecipitate
* Fibrinogen concentrate
* Platelets


### Packed Cells

* 1 unit ≈ 200-300mL\
Generally raises Hb by ~10g/dL.


### Fresh Frozen Plasma

* 1 unit ≈ 200-300 ml\
Generally raises fibrinogen by 7-10mg/dL.
* Dose is usually 10-15ml/kg
* Contains all clotting factors
* ABO compatibility highly desirable but not essential


### Cryoprecipitate

Derived from plasma, and contains concentrated:

* **Fibrinogen**\
Main advantage, as there is little fibrinogen in FFP.
* Factor VIII
* Factor XIII
* Fibronectin
* vWF


### Fibrinogen Concentrate

Freeze-dried human plasma:

* Contains ~1g of fibrinogen
* Reconstituted with water
* Used in massive transfusion


### Platelets

* 1 unit ≈ 50ml\
Generally raises platelet cont by ~10× 10^9^/L.
* ABO match preferable but not essential


### Single-Factor Concentrates

Donor plasma isolated or recombinant production of concentrated:

* AT III
* Activated factor VII
* Factor VIII
* Factor IX


## Transfusion Strategy

:::info
All targets vary depending on the clinical situation.
:::

### Haemoglobin

:::column-margin
Although anaemia is detrimental, it is apparent that correction to a normal haemoglobin is also not helpful. Transfusion strategies aim to balance the harm of anaemia and of transfusion.\
\
Ideally, a patient should be prevented from becoming anaemic in the first place.
:::

* \>70g/L: Essentially always appropriate
* \>80g/L: Coronary artery disease
* 80-90g/L: Active haemorrhage\
Less restrictive strategy appropriate to keep a margin of safety.
* \>90g/L: Essentially never appropriate


### Platelets

* \>20×10^9^/L: Essentially always appropriate
* \>50×10^9^/L: Most surgery or invasive procedures 
* \>100×10^9^/L: Select surgery or procedures\
Neurosurgery, intraocular surgery, neuraxial anaesthesia.
* Generally not appropriate for:
	* ITP or other immune-related destruction
	* TTP
	* HUS


### Coagulation Factors

Coagulation factor replacement:

* Can be performed with:
	* FFP
	* Freeze-dried plasma
	* Factor concentrates (PCC)
	* Cryoprecipitate
* Appropriate for:
	* Coagulopathy
		* DIC
		* Massive transfusion
		* Liver disease
	* Single-factor deficiency when single-factor replacement is not available
	* Reversal of warfarin when PCC unavailable
	* Plasma exchange\
	Though albumin is generally preferred.


### Approaches to Transfusion

Based on coagulation profile:

* INR >1.5\
Give 4 units FFP.
* Fibrinogen <1g/dL\
Give 10 units cryoprecipitate.
* Fibrinogen 1-1.5g/dL\
Give 5 units cryoprecipitate.
* Platelets <50g×10^9^/L\
Give 5 units of platelets.
