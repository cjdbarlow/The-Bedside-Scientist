# Transfusion and Blood Products



## Blood Typing

Involves:

* Blood group (ABO) typing\
Takes ~15 minutes.
* Antibody screen\
Screening for minor antibodies other than anti-A and anti-B. Takes up to **45** minutes.
	* **If** antibody screen is **normal**, computer cross-match can typically match unit of blood in <5 minutes

Typing balances risk (of transfusion reactions) against availability. Blood can be:

* [Uncrossmatched](unxmatch)\
Immediately available.
* Group-specific uncrossmatched blood\
	* 99.8% chance of compatibility
	* Generally available within 5-10 minutes
* Group-specific partial crossmatch
	* 99.94% chance of compatibility
* Group-specific fully crossmatched
	* 99.95% chance of compatibility
	* Generally available in 30-45 minutes

### Use of Uncrossmatched Blood {#unxmatch}

If transfusion is required **before ABO typing** is complete, uncrossmatched blood can be given. Using uncrossmatched blood:

* Consumes limited pool of universal units
* Has a higher risk of transfusion reaction\
Risk of reaction from minor antibodies.
	* Present in **2% of population**\
	Prevalence **↑ with age**.
	* Typically IgG mediated
	* Does not generally cause major haemolysis\
	Overall **haemolysis rate of emergency transfusion is 0.1%**.
* Type for **packed red cells** is **O-**
	* Rh- (or unknown) females of childbearing age shoul receive O-\
	Risk of rhesus disease if Rh+ blood given.
		* If prolonged/repeated transfusion required, use of Rh+ blood can be justified due to limited availability of Rh- blood
* Type for **plasma** is usually **AB+**, but can be A+ with **low anti-B**
	* Very limited supply of AB+ plasma
	* Use of A+ plasma with low anti-B plasma is epidemiologically justified\
		* Low risk due to low overall presence of AB+ and B+ individuals
		* Demonstrated to be safe
* Is justified in patients needing emergency transfusion, but not in those patients who are stable enough to wait until crossmatched units become available


## Blood Products

Include:

* Packed cells
* Fresh frozen plasma
* Cryoprecipitate


### Packed Cells

* 1 unit ≈ 200-300ml\
Generally raises Hb by ~10g/dL.


### Fresh Frozen Plasma

* 1 unit ≈ 200-300 ml\
Generally raises fibrinogen by 7-10mg/dL.
* Dose is usually 10-15ml/kg
* Contains all clotting factors
* ABO compatibility highly desirable but not essential


### Platelets

* 1 unit ≈ 50ml\
Generally raises platelet cont by ~10x10^9^/L.
* ABO compatibility preferable but not essential


## Transfusing

Goals of transfusion are generally:

* Hb 80-90g/dL\
Whilst haemorrhage ongoing.
* INR < 1.5
* APTT < 40s
* Fibrinogen >2g/dL
* Platelet > 50x10^9^/L
* Temperature > 36°C
* Ionised calcium > 0.85mmol/L

### Approaches to Transfusion

Based on coagulation profile:

* INR > 1.5\
Give 4 units FFP.
* Fibroinogen < 1\
Give 10 units cryoprecipitate.
* Fibrinogen 1-1.5\
Give 5 units cryoprecipitate.
* Platlets < 50\
Give 5 units of platelets.
