# Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant {#sec-stem_cell}

:::info
Historically referred to as bone marrow transplant.
:::

Haematopoietic stem cell transplant is a potentially curative treatment for haematological malignancies, and classified by the source of replacement stem cells:

* **Autologous**\
Reinfusion of peripheral blood harvested during periods of remission.
	* Risk of infusion of own tumour cells, with subsequent relapse
	* Mortality ~5%
	* No risk of GvHD
* **Allogeneic**\
Infusion of donor stem cells.
	* Sibling or unrelated donor
	* Requires immunosuppression
	* Mortality higher than autologous transplant
	* Risk of both GvHD and graft failure

## Indications

Include:

* Haematological malignancy
	* Leukaemias
	* Lymphomas
	* Myelofibrosis
	* Myelodysplastic syndrome
* Bone marrow failure syndromes
* Certain other malignancies
	* Breast cancers
	* Ovarian cancer
	* Germ cell tumours
	* Small cell lung cancer
	* Renal cell cancer
* Autoimmune diseases
	* MS
	* Systemic sclerosis
	* Crohn's disease
	* SLE
	* MG
	* Various systemic vasculitides
* Inborn Errors of Immunity
	* Severe Combined Immunodeficiencies
	* Primary HLH

## Technique

Transplantation occurs in two phases:

1. **Myeloablation**\
Destruction of all haematopoietic cells, aimed to kill all tumour cells.
	* Usually consists of both:
		* Chemotherapy
		* Total body irradiation
	* Reduced intensity options exist for older or frailer patients\
	Provide enough immunosuppression to permit engraftment.
2. Infusion of new cells\
Either autologous or allogeneic. The time after infusion is broken down into:
	* **Pre-engraftment**\
	Time between infusion and when stem cells begun haematopoiesis.
		* Usually lasts <30 days
		* Profound neutropenia and susceptibility to bacterial infections\
		Gram positive infections predominate due to the wide variety of Gram negative-covering antibiotics available.
		* Most ICU admissions occur during this phase
	* **Early post-engraftment**\
	Time from recovery of cell counts.
		* Classically day 30-100
		* Impaired cell-mediated immunity
		* Vulnerability persists to:
			* Viral infections
				* CMV\
				Prophylactic ganciclovir used for CMV positive recipients, or with positive donors.
			* Fungal infections
				* *Candida* spp.
				* PJP
				* *Aspergillus* spp.
	* **Late post-engraftment**\
	Indefinite period that consists of impaired cell mediated and humoral immunity.


## Complications

* B
	* Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage\
	Pulmonary endothelial injury secondary to chemotherapy.
		* Risks include:
			* Age
			* Intensity of myeloablation
			* GvHD
			* Total body irradiation
			* Allogeneic transplant
		* Presentation with:
			* Fever
			* Dyspnoea
			* Cough\
			Haemoptysis is rare.
			* Blood alveolar lavage samples
		* Management:
			* Steroids
	* Idiopathic pneumonia
* D
	* PRES
* H
	* **Graft failure**\
	Failure to establish new population of bone marrow cells.
		* <5% after allogeneic infusion
		* Causes include:
			* Inadequate dose
			* Infection
			* GvHD
		* Management:
			* G-CSF
			* Stem cell re-infusion
			* Repeat transplant
	* Veno-occlusive disease\
	Thrombotic occlusion of small hepatic veins.
		* Presents as:
			* Hepatomegaly
			* Jaundice
			* Ascites
		* Risk factors:
			* Certain myeloablative regimens
			* Pre-existing abnormal LFTs
		* Management with defibrotide
	* Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder\
	Uncontrolled proliferation of EBV-infected B cells, causing impaired T-cell immunity.
	* TTP
* I
	* Engraftment syndrome\
	Transient inflammatory state occurring due to release of cytokines by engraftment of donor cells.
		* Features include:
			* Fever
			* Rash
			* Non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema
			* Abnormal LFTs
			* Encephalopathy
		* ↑ Risk with G-CSF
		* Management with steroids and supportive care
	* **Infection**\
	Highest risk in the pre-engraftment, followed by early post-engraftment phase.
	* **GvHD**
