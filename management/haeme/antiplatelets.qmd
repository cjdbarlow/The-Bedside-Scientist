# Antiplatelets

Antiplatelet agents are:

* Used predominantly for **arterial disease**
* Include:
	* NSAIDs\
	Less potent, reversible, usually resolves within 24 hours.
	* **Aspirin**\
	Irreversible.
	* P2Y~12~ antagonists\
	Irreversible, and ↑ potency compared to aspirin, with ↑ bleeding risk.
		* Clopidogrel
		* Ticagrelor
		* Prasugrel
	* GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors\
	Reversible with cessation.
		* Tirofiban
		* Eptifibatide
		* Abciximab


## Indications

* Arterial stenting

## Contraindications

## Options

### Aspirin

Aspirin provides:

* Irreversible inhibition\
Duration of platelet lifespan (5-10 days).

**Key** pharmacological **properties**:



### Clopidogrel

Clopidogrel:

* Irreversible inhibition

**Key** pharmacological **properties**:

* Genetic 


### Ticagrelor

* More predictable inhibition than clopidogrel
* ↑ Bleeding risk relative to clopidogrel

**Key** pharmacological **properties**:

* Genetic 

## Reversal

All antiplatelet agents are minimimally reversible, therapeutic options include:

* Cessation
* Other haemostatic measures
* DDAVP\
May have effect in aspirin-induced platelet inhibition, minimal evidence in other contexts.
* Platelet transfusions
	* More effective in aspirin
	* May be ineffective in reversing ticagrelor


### Tirofiban

* Reversal in 4-8 hours following cessation


### Eptifibatide

* Reversal in 4-8 hours following cessation


### Abciximab

* Reversal in 1-2 days following cessation
