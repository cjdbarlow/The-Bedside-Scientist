* 1 unit ≈ 200-300mL\
Generally raises Hb by ~10g/dL.
* Are not fully functional\
Develop **storage lesions** after donation, rendering them progressively less effective:
	* ↓ O~2~ offloading at tissues which impedes oxygen extraction
	* ↓ Cell deformability\
	↓ ATP reduces cell membrane maintenance, resulting in loss of biconcave disc shape. This causes:
		* ↓ Microvascular flow
		* ↓ Functional capillary density
	* ↑ Fragility\
	↑ Risk of haemolysis and reticuloendothelial destruction.
		* Conjugated bilirubinaemia
		* Accumulation of metabolic products
	* ↑ Neutrophil activation
* Are generally routinely **leukcoreduced**\
Removal of granulocytes and leukocytes prior to storage which:
	* ↓ Transfusion reactions\
	TRALI, febrile reactions, CMV infection, transfusion-associated GvHD, alloimmunisation.
	* ↓ Storage lesions
* Transfusion should:
	* Begin once removed from refrigerator
	* Complete within 4 hours of removal
	* Returned to controlled storage within 30 minutes of removal (if not transfused)
	* Cannot be returned if out of controlled storage for >30 minutes

:::

* 1 unit ≈ 200-300 ml\
Contains normal levels of clotting factors, albumin, and immunoglobulin:
	* ~0.5g of fibrinogen
	* 0.7 IU/mL of Factor VIKI
* Dose is usually 10-15ml/kg\
This is a substantial volume for a normovolaemic patient - consider factor concentrates.
* Stored at -18°C to prevent clotting factor degradation\
Must be thawed prior to administration.
* ABO compatibility highly desirable but not essential
	* Low-titre anti-A and anti-B are preferable when transfusing ABO incompatible plasma
* Transfusion should:
	* Commence within 30 minutes
	* Be completed within 4 hours of thawing
	* Cannot be returned after 30 minutes out of controlled storage
		* Cannot be re-frozen
		* If returned within 30 minutes, it can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours at 2-6°C and re-issued

:::column-margin
FFP should not be used as a volume expander for hypovolaemia in absence of an appropriate indication.
:::

### Prothrombin Complex Concentrates

Freeze-dried preparation from donor plasma that:

:::column-margin
3-factor PCC is also known as factor IX complex.
:::

* Contains the vitamin-K dependent clotting factors
	* Factor II
	* Factor VII\
	Not present in all preparations; so these are usually described as either:
		* 4-factor PCC\
		Contain all factors.
		* 3-factor PCC\
		Contain II, IX, and X.
	* Factor IX
	* Factor X
* Is indicated for:
	* Correction of vitamin K antagonism
	* Correction of coagulopathy in absence of hypovolaemia

:::column-margin
I find PCC useful in the operating room for *rapidly* correcting coagulopathy, as it can be given far more quickly than an equivalent factor-load of FFP.
:::

### Single-Factor Concentrates

Single factors are produced either through isolation of donor plasma isolated or recombinant production. Available factors include:

* **Antithrombin III**\
Treatment of heparin resistance:
	* For CPB: 1000-2000 units if inadequate ACT after >600 U/kg of UFH
* **Activated Factor VII**
	* Vitamin-K dependent clotting factor that enhances haemostasis at site of injury without generalised hypercoagulability
		* Clots formed are stronger and more resistant to fibrionlysis than normal clot
		* Risk of generalised hypercoagulable state
	* Indicated for congenital factor VII deficiency, or inhibitors to VIII or IX, but the majority of use is off-label from refractory surgical or traumatic haemorrhage
	* Caution in patients with history of thromboembolic events
	* Consider when:
		* Fibrinogen >0.5g/dL
		* Platelets >50×10^9^/L
		* pH >7.1
	* Dose variable
		* 20μg/kg increments in semi-controlled situations
		* 90-120μg/kg for exsanguinating trauma 
* **Factor VIII**
	* Heat treated to inactivate HIV
	* For treatment of haemophilia A
* **Factor IX**

:::column-margin
Activated Factor VII is also known as recombinant activated coagulation factor VII, FVIIa, rFVIIa, eptacog alfa, and NovoSeven.
:::

### Cryoprecipitate

FFP derivative which:

:::column-margin
Cryoprecipitate is manufactured by freezing and then thawing FFP, collecting the precipitate, and then re-suspending it in plasma.
:::

* May be presented as:
	* Single donor\
	30-40mL.
	* Apheresis\
	~50mL.
* Stored at -18°C
* Contains concentrated:
	* **Fibrinogen**\
	Main advantage, as there is little fibrinogen in FFP.
	* Factor VIII
	* Factor XIII
	* Fibronectin
	* vWF
* Transfusion should:
	* Commence within 30 minutes
	* Be completed within 4 hours
	* Cannot be returned after 30 minutes out of controlled storage


### Fibrinogen Concentrate

Freeze-dried human plasma:

* Contains ~1g of fibrinogen
* Reconstituted with water
* Used in massive transfusion


## Platelets

* 1 unit ≈ 50mL\
Generally raises platelet count by ~10× 10^9^/L.
* Usually come in ~200mL, 4-unit bags\
These may be:
	* Pooled from whole blood donation from separate donors
	* Single-donor, collected via apheresis
* ABO match is preferable but not essential
	* Apheresis platelets have a lower titre of anti-A and anti-B and have a lower risk of haemolysis\
	These are preferred when ↓ exposure of the recipient to multiple donors is desirable.
* Stored at 20-24°C with constant agitation
* Transfusion should:
	* Commence as soon as received
	* Completed within 1 hour of issue
	* *May* be able to be returned after 1 hour, conditional on storage

:::column-margin
The volume of incompatible plasma administered with platelets is significantly higher (due to greater platelet volume), but because of greater limitations in platelet availability the higher risk is assumed necessary.
:::

## Granulocytes

Granulocyte (neutrophils) are harvested from the buffy coat and:

* Indicated for neutropenic sepsis
* Must be ABO and Rh compatible
* Irradiated prior to transfusion


## Whole Blood

Whole blood:

:::column-margin
1:1:1 mixtures of fractionated products do not faithfully reconstitute whole blood, but instead yeild a dilute mixture with:

* Haematocrit 29%
* Platelet count ~90× 10^9^/L
:::

* Has full haemostatic function\
Preferable to fractionated products for treatment of massive haemorrhage, when available.
* Has an ↑ complexity of type matching\
Options include:
	* Group-specific whole blood transfusion\
	Transfuse from donor with identical ABO group.
	* Low-titre type-O whole blood transfusion\
	From O donor with low anti-A or anti-B levels.
		* This ↑↑ complexity of determining the patients blood group
		* Group should be taken prior to administering low-titre whole blood
		* Standard of care in WWII, as well as the wars in Korea and Vietnam
* Collected from donors into citrated bags
	* Goal is generally ~450mL/585g
	* Bag should be agitated periodically to ↓ risk of clot formation
* Is divided into:
	* Fresh whole blood
		* Stored at room temperature and administered within 24 hours
		* Generally not tested for transfusion-transmitted diseases and so not appropriate for civilian use
		* Refrigerated within 8 hours and stored
	* Stored whole blood
		* Can be fully tested for transfusion-transmitted disease
		* Can be kept for:
			* 21 days in CPD (Citrate Phosphate Dextrose)
			* 35 days in CPDA-1 (Citrate-phosphate-dextrose adenine)


## Irradiation of Blood Products

Exposure of donated cellular products to high (25Gy) doses of ionised radiation:

* Destroys contained lymphocytes
	* ↓ Risk of transfusion-associated GvHD
* Does not make the blood radioactive, and is not otherwise damaging
	* Some units may routinely irradiate all cellular products
	* Is not required for non-cellular (e.g. plasma) products
* Is indicated for transfusion to patients who are:
	* Immunocompromised
		* Lymphoma
		* Stem-cell transplants
		* Aplastic anaemia
	* Related-donor transfusion
	* Granulocyte transfusions
	* HLA-matched platelets
	* Neonates
