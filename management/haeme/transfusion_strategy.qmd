# Blood Transfusion

:::info
All targets vary depending on the clinical situation.
:::

## Haemoglobin

:::column-margin
Although anaemia is detrimental, it is apparent that correction to a normal haemoglobin is also not helpful. Transfusion strategies aim to balance the harm of anaemia and of transfusion.\
\
Ideally, a patient should be prevented from becoming anaemic in the first place.
:::

* \>70g/L: Essentially always appropriate
* \>80g/L: Coronary artery disease
* 80-90g/L: Active haemorrhage\
Less restrictive strategy appropriate to keep a margin of safety.
* \>90g/L: Essentially never appropriate


## Platelets

* \>20×10^9^/L: Essentially always appropriate
* \>50×10^9^/L: Most surgery or invasive procedures 
* \>100×10^9^/L: Select surgery or procedures\
Neurosurgery, intraocular surgery, neuraxial anaesthesia.
* Generally not appropriate for:
	* ITP or other immune-related destruction
	* TTP
	* HUS


## Coagulation Factors

Coagulation factor replacement:

* Can be performed with:
	* FFP
	* Freeze-dried plasma
	* Factor concentrates (PCC)
	* Cryoprecipitate
* Appropriate for:
	* Coagulopathy
		* DIC
		* Massive transfusion
		* Liver disease
	* Single-factor deficiency when single-factor replacement is not available
	* Reversal of warfarin when PCC unavailable
	* Plasma exchange\
	Though albumin is generally preferred.


## Approaches to Transfusion

Based on coagulation profile:

* INR >1.5\
Give 4 units FFP.
* Fibrinogen <1g/dL\
Give 10 units cryoprecipitate.
* Fibrinogen 1-1.5g/dL\
Give 5 units cryoprecipitate.
* Platelets <50g×10^9^/L\
Give 5 units of platelets.
