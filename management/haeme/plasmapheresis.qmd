# Plasma Exchange

General technique of extracorporeal blood filtration to separate cellular or plasma components. Can be divided into:

* Cytapheresis\
Removal of cells.
* Plasmapheresis\
Removal of plasma, and replacement with donor plasma or albumin. Usually performed via filtration or filtration or centrifugation of plasma and blood.


## Indications

Specific indications:

:::column-margin
In general, for a substance to be effectively removed by apheresis it must be:

* Present intravascularly
* Unable to be removed by more simple means (RRT)\
Usually due to molecular weight or plasma protein binding.
* Have a long enough half-life\
Otherwise, just wait?
* Not be rapidly replenished
* Not have a more simple treatment available
:::

* Cellular
	* Leukocytosis\
	e.g. ALL/AML.
	* Sickle cell crisis
* Proteins
	* Autoantibodies
		* Myasthenia gravis
		* Goodpasture Syndrome
		* GBS\
		Equivalent to IV IgG.
		* APS\
		Indicated for catastrophic APS.
		* Thrombotic Thrombocytopaenic Purpura
	* Immunoglobulins
		* Monoclonal gammopathy
		* Cryoglobulinaemia
		* Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia
	* Immune complexes
		* Glomerulonephritis
	* Protein-bound substances
		* Toxins\
			* Heavy metals
				* Mercury
				* Cisplatin
			* Herbal preparations
				* Kava
			* Digoxin
			* Paraquat\
			Relatively ineffective.
		* Thyroid storm
* Triglycerides\
Indicated for pancreatitis secondary to hypertriglycerideaemia (>1g/dL).

:::column-margin
Efficacy of plasma exchange for toxins is generally over-rated due to the relatively small volume of distribution of the intravascular compartment.

## Contraindications


## Equipment

## Technique

* Placement of a vascular dialysis catheter\
As for RRT.
* Removal of **1-1.5x** plasma volume\
Single exchange of 40mL/kg can remove ~50% of plasma factors (including clotting factors) if not replaced, with replenishment in 24-48 hours.
* Repeat daily or second-daily


## Complications

* Procedural
	* Vascular injury
* Pump
	* Hypocalcaemia\
	Citrate mediated.
	* Haemolysis
	* Air embolism
	* Haemodynamic instability
	* Hypothermia
* Replacement fluid effects
	* Transfusion reactions
	* Removal of other substances\
	e.g. Loss of therapeutic drugs.
	* Anaemia
	* Coagulopathy\
	Dilutional.
	* Sepsis
