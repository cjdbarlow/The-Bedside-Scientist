# Massive Transfusion


> Definitions are not practical as they are all retrospective

Various definitions which include:

* 10 PRBC in 24 hours
* Whole blood volume in 24 hours
* ⩾50% of blood volume in 4 hours

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Predicting massive transfusion:

* Assessment of Blood Consumption (ABC Score)  
⩾3 factors suggests 85% likelihood of MTP.
	* HR ⩾120
	* SBP ⩽90
	* Penetrating injury
	* Positive FAST scan
* Injury patterns
	* Uncontrolled:
		* Truncal bleeding
		* Junctional haemorrhage
		* Large soft tissue bleeding
	* Amputations
	* Mangled extremities
	* Clinical coagulopathy
	* Severe hypothermia
