# Poisoning

Acute poisoning is:

:::column-margin
This covers the general principles of approaching a poisoned patient. Management of specific agents is covered elsewhere.
:::

* Common\
5-10% of admissions.
* Usually intentional
* Managed predominantly with supportive treatment


## Principles

Management should consider:

* **R**esuscitation
* **R**isk assessment
* **S**upportive Care\
Principles of supportive care for the ICU patient.
* **I**nvestigations
* **D**econtamination
* **E**nhanced Elimination
* **A**ntidotes\
Covered under the specific drug overdose.
* **D**isposition


### Resuscitation

* A
	* Remove dentures
	* Clear oropharynx
	* Tracheal intubation in almost all cases
* B
	* Supplemental oxygen
	* Respiratory acidosis generally indicates need for assisted ventilation
* C
	* Venous access
	* Fluid resuscitation or vasoactives as required

:::column-margin
Intubation is reasonable to avoid in patients with a GHB or GBL overdose who will reliably resume consciousness in 2-4 hours.
:::

### Risk Assessment

:::priority
* **Ascertain nature** and **severity** of **poisoning**
* **Requirement** for **specific therapy** or time-limited interventions
:::

History:

:::column-margin
Collateral and circumstantial history can be ascertained from:

* Family
* Medicine cabinet
	* Counting missing tablets
	* Checking medical records and pharmacy prescription
:::

* Drug factors
	* Drugs taken\
		* May be multiple or unknown (children)
		* Always assume the maximum amount if uncertain
	* Dose
	* Timing taken
* Dose

:::column-margin
Consider **NAI** in **children**.
:::

Examination:

:::column-margin
Differential diagnoses of coma should include:

* ICH
	* SAH
	* EDH
	* SDH
* Meningitis
* Encephalitis
* Diabetic coma
* Uraemic encephalopathy
:::

* General
	* Needle marks
	* Self-harm
	* Heart rate
	* Blood pressure
	* Respiratory rate
* Neurological exam
	* GCS
	* Qualitative evaluation of conscious state
	* Pupil size
	* Tone, reflexes, and clonus


### Investigations

**Bedside**:

* **BSL**
* ABG/VBG
	* Acid-base status
		* Metabolic acidosis
		* Respiratory acidosis
		* Respiratory alkalosis\
		Classically in early salicylate overdose.
	* Anion gap
* **ECG**


**Laboratory**:

* Biochemistry
	* Renal function\
	Affects clinical course of most drug overdoses.
* Drug levels\
For specific poisonings.
* Urine\
Retain sample for later analysis.

:::column-margin
Routine toxin dipsticks are not recommended due to false-positive rate and cross-reactivity with prescription medicine.
:::


**Imaging**:

* CXR
	* Aspiration


### Decontamination

:::info
Two **viable** methods:

* Activated charcoal
* Whole bowel irrigation
:::

:::column-margin
Historically, two other methods were used but **no longer recommended**:

* **Induced emesis**\
Removes only limited volumes and ↑ aspiration risk.
* **Gastric lavage**\
Removes insignificant volume, may propel unabsorbed poison into small intestine.
:::

**Activated charcoal**:

* Very effective absorber of toxins in GIT due to high surface area and porous structure
* 1^st^ line for most poisonings\
Drugs that are **not effectively removed** include:
	* Alcohols
	* Metals
	* Corrosives\
	Acids and alkalis.
	* Pesticides
	* Cyanide
* Should be **given** to **all patients within 1 hour** of **ingestion** of a toxic dose
* 1g/kg up to 50g
	* May still be given if overdose ↓ gastric emptying or slow-release preparation\
	e.g. Opioids, anticholinergics, TCA.
	* **Repeat doses** may be given if drug is **enterohepatically recirculated** or a slow-release preparation
* Should **not be given** if **↓ GCS** due to risk of **aspiration**\
Intubate, then administer via NG.


**Whole Bowel Irrigation**:

* Gut decontamination with non-absorbable polyethylene glycol solution
* ↓ GI absorption by creating high volume of liquid stool
* **Indicated** for **limited number** of poisons:
	* Iron
	* Lithium
	* 'Body packers'
	* Slow-release preparations
		* Potassium
		* Calcium channel blockers
		* β-blockers
		* Theophylline
* Requires monitoring of electrolyte concentrations
* Administer 25mL/kg/hr up to 2L/hr via NGT
	* Place patient on commode
	* Continue until effluent is clear
	* Stop irrigation if abdominal distension occurs


### Enhanced Elimination

**Urinary alkalinisation**:

:::column-margin
Urinary alkalinisation is also known as forced alkaline diuresis.
:::

* Creating an alkaline urine to trap ionised drug in the renal tubule and prevent tubular reabsorption
* **Effective if** the **drug** is:
	* A **weak acid**
	* Predominantly **renally eliminated**
	* Creating significant toxicity
* In practice, used for:
	* Salicylates
	* Phenobarbital
	* Methotrexate
	* Chlorpropamide
* Achieved by sodium bicarbonate IV
	* 1-2mmol/kg IV
	* Infuse isotonic bicarbonate at 250mL/hr\
	Dilute 150mL of 8.4% in 850mL of D5W to produce isotonic bicarbonate.
* Requires:
	* Regular **monitoring** of **serum potassium**\
	Hypokalaemia will occur as potassium is exchanged for hydrogen in the tubule, which ↓ urinary pH as well as being independently significant.
	* Hypocalcaemia may also occur
	* Adjust infusion to maintain urinary pH of 7.5-8.5

:::column-margin
Urinary alkalinisation relies on the following:

* Drugs can only pass through lipid membranes in their unionised form\
* Ionised drugs are water soluble and trapped by surrounding lipid membranes\
e.g. In the renal tubule.
* **Weak acids** will lose their hydrogen ion in a basic environment, and become their ionised conjugate base\
$AH \leftrightarrow H^+ + A^-$
* The Henderson-Hasselbach equation: 
	* Describes the relationship between the:
		* Environmental pH
		* Drug pKA
		* Concentration of ionised and unionised forms
	* $pH = pKa + {\log_{10} {[A^-] \over [HA]}}$\
	If concentrations are equal, then pH = pKa as $\log_{10} 0 = 1$
:::

**Haemodialysis**:

:::column-margin
Haemodialysis is recommended for severe overdose of:

* Salicylate
* Lithium\
Chronic.
* Theophylline
* Carbamazepine
* Metformin
* Paracetamol
* Toxic alcohols
* Phenytoin\
Some preparations.
* Valproate
* Potassium salts
:::

* Extracorporeal filtration is effective for drugs with:
	* Small V~D~\
	Essentially confined to plasma.
	* Small molecule\
	Able to cross semi-permeable membrane.
	* Rapidly redistribution from tissue to plasma\
	Not trapped in tissues.
	* Slow endogenous clearance


**Lipid Emulsion Therapy**:

* Role in local anaesthetic toxicity
* Unclear mechanism, may relate to either:
	* Large lipid volume that lipid soluble drugs dissolve into
	* Energy substrate for shocked myocardium
* 20% lipid emulsion given:
	* At 1.5mL/kg followed by infusion at 15mL/kg/hr
	* If further instability:
		* 1.5mL/kg Q5M
		* ↑ Rate to 30mL/kg/hr
	* Up to 12mL/kg
