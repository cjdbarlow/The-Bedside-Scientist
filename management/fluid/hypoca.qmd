# Hypocalcaemia

Hypocalcaemia (serum calcium <2.2 mmol/L) is a common and occasionally severe electrolyte disorder. 

{{< include /includes/calcium_dist.qmd >}}

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Common electrolyte abnormality:

* 18% of hospital inpatients
* 85% of ICU patients

## Pathophysiology

{{< include /includes/calcium_patho.qmd >}}

### Aetiology

* ↓ PTH
	* Primary
		* Parathyroid/thyroid surgery
		* Autoimmune disease
	* Secondary
		* Sepsis
		* Hypomagnesaemia\
		<0.4mmol/L.
* ↑ PTH	
	* ↓ Vitamin D
		* Dietary
			* Malabsorption
		* ↓ Sunlight exposure
		* Renal failure
		* Pregnancy
	* PTH resistance
		* Hypomagnesaemia
	* Calcium loss/consumption
		* Hyperphosphataemia
			* TLS
		* Acute pancreatitis
		* Clotting
		* Bone metastases
		* Alkalosis
	* Drugs
		* Citrate\
		Total calcium remains normal, because the citrate-calcium complex is measured and accounted for.
		* Bisphosphonates
		* Phenytoin

:::column-margin
A primary alkalosis (e.g. from hyperventilation) causes an ionised hypocalcaemia by ↑ calcium binding to albumin. However, many other causes of hypocalcaemia also cause metabolic *acid*osis (e.g. TLS, renal failure).
:::

## Clinical Manifestations

* C
	* Long QT\
	TDP if severe.
* D
	* Paraesthesias
	* Confusion/delirium
* E
	* Twitching
	* Spasm/Tetany
		* Carpopedal spasm

:::column-margin
Chvostek’s sign - tapping the parotid gland over the facial nerve to induce facial spasm - is a poor discriminator of ↓ calcium. 10% of normal patients are positive, and ~30% of hypocalcaemic patients are negative.

## Investigations

**Bedside**:

* ABG

**Laboratory**:

:::column-margin
{{< include /includes/calcium_correction.qmd >}}
:::

* Bloods
	* PTH\
	Should be ↑ in the setting of hypocalcaemia.
	* 25-hydroxyvitamin D
	* Renal function
	* Albumin
	* Lipase\
	Pancreatitis.
	* Magnesium
	* Phosphate\
		* ↑ Phosphate associated with primary hypoparathyroidism\
		Phosphate also chelates calcium, which may contribute to ↓ calcium.
		* ↓ Phosphate associated with secondary hypoparathyroidism

**Other**:

* ECG\
Long QT, TDP.

## Management

:::info
Mild hypocalcaemia (iCa^2+^ 0.8-1.1) in the critically ill is common and does not require replacement.
:::

:::caution
IV replacement should be used for anyone with:

* Neuromuscular irritability
* Serum calcium **<1.9mmol/L**
:::

**Acute**:

* Correct any **hypomagnesaemia**
* IV Calcium Gluconate
	* 10mL 10% (diluted to 50-100mL) over 10 minutes\
	Cardiac monitor due to risk of dysrhythmia.
	* Infusion\
	100mL 10% (diluted to 1L), run at 50mL/hr. Expect ~0.3-0.5mmol/L ↑ in calcium over 6 hours. IV Calcium Gluconate infusion if required, titrating rate to serum calcium.


:::column-margin
Calcium chloride can also be used, but requires a large reliable drip or CVC due to the risk of devastating tissue necrosis on extravasation.
:::

:::column-margin
{{< include /includes/calcium_equiv.qmd >}}
:::

**Sub-acute**:

* ↓ PTH\
	* Calcitriol 0.25-1ug/day
	* Oral calcium supplementation
* Normal/↑ PTH
	* 50,000 IU Cholecalciferol\

:::column-margin
Cholecalciferol requires PTH for conversion, which is why calcitriol is used in the ↓ PTH group.
:::


**Persistent**:

* If calcium continues to fall despite treatment, consider:
	* Thiazide\
	↑ Renal calcium reabsorption.
	* Recombinant PTH
