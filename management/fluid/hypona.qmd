# Hyponatraemia 

Hyponatraemia is:

* The excess of body water relative to sodium
* Defined as a serum sodium level <135mmol/L
* Further divided by:
	* Serum concentrations and symptoms into:
		* Mild  
		125-134.
		* Moderate  
		120-124.
		* Severe  
		⩽119.
	* Time course:	
		* Acute  
		⩽48 hours.
		* Chronic  
		⩾48 hours.

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

* Most common electrolyte abnormality
	* 30-40% of hospitalised patients
	* 25-30% of ICU patients
		* ~2.7% mild
		* ~1.2% severe
* Increasing severity is associated with increased mortality

* Risk factors for rapid correction of hyponatraemia  
Increased frequency of monitoring should be performed in patients with:
	* Hypovolaemia
	* Glucocorticoid deficiency
	* Beer potomania
	* Polydipsia
	* Desmopressin cessation


## Pathophysiology

Basic principles:

* Water diffuses freely across cell membranes
* Hyponatraemia indicates extracellular hyposmolality, and therefore intracellular hypoosmolality
* Water influx into cells causes swelling, and may lead to life-threatening cerebral oedema
	* Initially, neurons excrete osmoles to reduce oedema formation
	* Swelling will occur when compensatory mechanisms are overwhelmed
* As hyponatraemia is corrected, neurons must reabsorb osmoles  
This process is slower than excretion, and may take several days.
	* Rapid correction of extracellular sodium may therefore lead to dehydration of brain cells as more water leaves the neuron as extracellular osmoles rise  
	This causes cells to shrink, and potentially demyelinate.

### Aetiology

Hyponatraemia is a disorder of water excess. Broadly, this may be either due to:

* Excessive water intake
* Failure of the kidneys to remove water

## Clinical Manifestations

Speed of onset is more important than the absolute value.

### History

### Examination

* Volume state  
Key in differentiating SIADH from CSW.


## Diagnostic Approach

> * Many different approaches have been described
> * The following approach is suggested because it doesn't require assessment of volume state, which clinicians are generally bad at


1. Measure serum osmolality
	* This allows exclusion of pseudo-hyponatraemic states  
	Pseudo-hyponatraemia is hyponotraemia occurring at isotonic osmolality.
	* Alternatively, serum sodium can be measured using a blood gas analyser  
	(Why this is the case is explained in detail under [investigations](#ix)).
2. Measure urine osmolality and sodium  
Patients can then be classified into:
	* Sodium retainers/sodium wasters  
	**Sodium retainers have urinary sodium ⩽40mmol/L.**
	* Water retainers/water wasters  
	**Water retainers have urinary osmolality ⩾100mmol/L.**


↑
↓

Causes of hyponatraemia can then be grouped into **six types**:
1. Hyper-osmotic hyponatraemia  
	* ↑ Serum osmolality  
	Pseudohyponatraemia.
	* Causes:
		* Mannitol
		* Sorbitol
		* IV contrast
		* Hyperglycaemia
2. Iso-osmotic hyponatraemia  
	* Normal serum osmolality  
	Pseudohyponatraemia.
	* Causes:
		* Hyperlipidaemia
		* Hyperproteinaemia
		* Post-TURP hyponatraemia
		* Massive uraemia
3. Sodium retainers, water retainers  
	* ↓ Serum osmolality
	* ↑ Urine osmolality, ↓ urine sodium  
	Sodium and water are being retained.
	* Causes:
		* Hypovolaemia
		* Heart failure  
		Consider TTE.
		* Cirrhosis  
		Consider LFTs.
		* Nephrotic syndrome  
		Consider 24 hour urinary protein.
4. Sodium wasters, water retainers  
	* ↓ Serum osmolality
	* ↑ Urine osmolality, ↑ urine sodium  
	Sodium is being inappropriately lost, and water reabsorption mechanisms are intact.
	* Causes:
		* Failure to reabsorb renal sodium
			* Diuretics
			* Polyuric ATN
			* Post-obstruction diuresis
			* Chronic renal failure
		* Mineralocorticoid deficiency  
		Consider cortisol level.
		* Hypothyroidism  
		Consider TFTs.
		* SIADH  
		Low urine output but euvolaemic.
		* Renal osmostat syndrome
		* Cerebral Salt Wasting  
		High urine output but hypovolaemic.
5. Sodium retainers, water wasters  
	* ↓ Serum osmolality
	* ↓ Urine osmolality, ↓ urine sodium.
	* Causes:
		* Polydipsia/Excess IV water
		* Malnutrition/Beer potomania
6. Sodium wasters, water wasters  
	* ↓ Serum osmolality
	* ↓ Urine osmolality, ↑ urine sodium  
	Failure of water and sodium reabsorption.
	* Renal sodium loss
		* Post-obstructive diuresis
		* Polyuric ATN
		* AKI

## Investigations{#ix}

Blood:

* Serum osmolality  
	* Normal >280mOsm/L
* Arterial blood gases  
* UECs
* Sodium Measurement  
Two methods are available:
	* Direct Ion-Specific Electrode (ISE)
		* Used in point of care systems
		* Undiluted blood is measured at the measuring electrode
	* Indirect ISE
		* Used in central laboratory analysers
		* Pre-diluted serum is used  
		Accuracy is therefore dependent on the volume of serum occupied by water (usually ~93%) versus by lipids and proteins (usually ~7%)
			* If there is a significantly high protein or lipid content:
				* The water fraction will be significantly less than 93%
				* The diluted fraction will contain fewer sodium ions than it would if it had a normal proportion of water  
				Serum sodium will be underestimated (leading to pseudohyponatraemia).
			* If there is a significantly low protein or lipid content (as in critical illness):
				* The water fraction will be greater than 93%
				* The diluted fraction will contain more sodium ions  
				Serum sodium will be overestimated.
				* Serum sodium can be partially corrected for hypoalbuminaemia by subtracting **0.7mmol/L for every 1g/dL** decrease in total protein.
* Cholesterol
	* Triglycerides
* Protein
* Random cortisol
* Short Synacthen test  
Test of adrenal insufficiency.


Urine:

* Urine osmolality
	* <100mOsm/L indicates (appropriate) suppression of ADH  
	This is an appropriate response to hyponatraemia, as the body is in a state of water excess. 
* Urine sodium  
Indicates how the kidneys are handling sodium.
	* 10mmol/L is the theoretical minimum
	* ⩽20mmol/L suggests hypovolaemia  
	May be **true** hypovolaemia, or **perceived** hypovolaemia (e.g. heart failure)
	* ⩾40mmol/L suggests SIADH  
	Key in discriminating CSW and hypovolaemia from SIADH.
* Urine/Plasma electrolyte ratio  
Ratio of urinary electrolytes to plasma electrolytes, given an indication of the relative tonicity of urine and plasma.
	* Typically given by: $${U \over P}Ratio = {[Na]_u + [K]_u \over [Na]_p}$$
	* A positive ratio indicates that electrolyte-free water excretion is negative  
	Fluid restriction alone is unlikely to correct sodium, as the kidneys are not excreting a dilute urine.
		* Water intake in excess of losses will cause further decrease in serum sodium
		* A very restrictive (e.g. <500ml/day) restriction will be required
	* A negative ratio indicates a degree of electrolyte-free water excretion


### Calculation of Sodium Deficit

Allows the total body sodium deficit to be crudely calculated, and therefore replaced.

$$Sodium \ Deficit = TBW \times Weight \times (Desired \ [Na^+] - Current \ [Na^+])$$, where:

* $$TBW$$ is the fraction of weight that is water:
	* $$~0.6$$ for men
	* $$~0.5$$ for women
* $$Weight$$ is body weight



## Management

> * Inadequate treatment may cause brain oedema
> * Excessively rapid correction may lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome
>	* Risk is increased in chronic hyponatraemia


* Free water restriction  
Important in hyponatraemia associated with cardiac failure.
	* Degree of restriction may be calculated from a spot urine/plasma electrolyte ratio
	* Unlikely to work if:
		* Urine osmolality is high
		* Urine output is low
	


* Hypertonic saline  
3% NaCl is the mainstay of treatment, and may be given peripherally.
	* For **severe, acute** hyponatraemia:  
	100ml of 3% NaCl over 10 minutes, repeated up to 3 times or until symptoms resolve.
		* Risk of ongoing oedema exceeds risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome
	* For **acute** (but less severe) hyponatraemia:
		* 1-2ml/kg/hr of 3% NaCl
		* Target increase in serum sodium up to 2mmol/L/hr until symptoms improve
	* For **chronic** hyponatraemia:
		* Infusion rate should be calculated based on calculated sodium deficit and desired rate of correction  
		$$Infusion \ Rate = Body \ Weight \ (kg) \times Desired \ Rate \ of \ Sodium \ Increase (mmol/L/hr)$$.
		* Target an increase in serum sodium of **4-8mmol/day**
	* Sodium levels should be checked every 2-4 hours during replacement
	* As sodium levels improve, a more dilute urine should be produced

* Volume state correction  
If the volume state is also low, then this should be corrected. This can be considered as a separate problem to hyponatraemia (i.e. have one therapy (3% NaCl) for hyponatraemia, and another therapy (0.9% NaCl) for hypovolaemia)/
	* Cease diuretics
	* Volume replacement  
	Normal saline is appropriate.

* Potassium replacement  
Hypokalaemia should also be corrected.
	* This will also cause a rise in serum sodium  
	Therefore potassium replacement should be considered when correcting sodium.


### Ineffective Therapies



## Complications

Osmotic Demyelination Syndrome:

* Also known as central pontine myelinolysis  
Though oedema and demyelination will occur everywhere there is myelin, not just in the pons.
* Risk factors include:
	* Severe hyponatraemia
	* Chronic hyponatraemia
	* Rapid correction of serum sodium
* Symptoms may appear 24-48 hours after correction  
These include:
	* Quadriplegia
	* Pseudobulbar palsy
	* Seizures
	* Coma
	* Death
