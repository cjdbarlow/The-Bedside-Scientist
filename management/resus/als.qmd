# Cardiac Arrest

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

* ~10/100,000 admissions
* Majority are expected and occur without attempt at resuscitation


## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

Management requires identification and correction of **reversible** cause:

* Hypoxia
* Hypovolaemia
* Hyper/hypokalaemia\
* Hypo/hyperthermia
* Tension pneumothorax
* Tamponade
* Toxins
* Thrombosis
	* Coronary
	* Pulmonary (embolism)

## Investigations

## Management

### Basic Life Support

Pillars of basic life support:

* **D**anger
* **R**esponse
* **S**end for help
* Open **A**irway
* Normal **B**reathing?\
* Start **C**PR
	* 30 compressions:2 breaths
	* 100 compressions/minute
	* 1/3^rd^ depth of chest
	* Lower half of sterum\
	Above this is less effective, below has ↑↑ risk of solid organ injury.

### Advanced Life Support

:::column-margin
In a witnessed and monitored arrest, with **pads already attached**, it is **ideal** to perform **3 stacked** (repeated) **shocks** prior to commencing CPR.\
\
In a witnessed and monitored arrest, **without pads**, it is *reasonable* to perform a precordial thump.
:::


* A
	* Airway\
	Adequate airway for gas exchange is the goal. Attempts at securing a definitive airway may excessively prolong time without CPR or gas exchange, without improving survival.
* B
	* End-tidal CO~2~
		* Correlates with cardiac index
		* Allows detection of ROSC
* C
	* Attach **D**efibrillator
		* 200J biphasic or 360J monophasic
		* Anterior-Posterior pad position may be slightly preferable as it is less dependent on heart position



### Post-Resuscitation Care

**Immediate**:

* Repeat a primary survey
* Perform 12-lead ECG
* Continue treatment of primary causes
* Commence hypothermia

**Supportive care**:

* A
	* Secure airway
* B
	* Normoxia\
	Avoid hypoxia; i.e. SpO~2~ 94-98%.
	* Normocapnoea
* C
	* Maintain perfusion\
	Patients usual BP or SBP >100mmHg.
* D
	* Avoid hyperglycaemia\
	Treat BSL >10mmol/L. May be exacerbated by TTM.
	* Treat seizures
	* Remain sedated
* E
	* **Targeted Temperature Management**\
	Keep temperature 35.5-36.5°C for 24 hours.
		* Should be achieved within 8 hours of ROSC
		* Active external cooling
		* Intravascular cooling catheter
	* Paralysis\
	May be needed to control shivering. Consideration for EEG monitoring if paralysing seizing patients.

:::column-margin
A variety of cooling methods have been tried, although with change in aims from hypothermia to normothermia many of these are no longer relevant. Historically, 4°C IV saline effectively ↓ temperature at risk of arrhythmia and volume load.

### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

## Complications

* Death
* C
	* Ischaemic injury
	* CPR complications
		* Rib/sternal fractures
		* Solid organ injury
* D
	* Hypoxic brain injury
	* Seizures\
	In ~36% of patients after ROSC.


## Prognosis

In-hospital cardiac arrest has a surprisingly good overall prognosis:

:::column-margin
Neuroprognostication is covered under @sec-neuroprog.
:::

* Hospital discharge in 52%\
Multifactorial:
	* Early detection
	* Early arrival of ALS


Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest requiring ICU admission is significantly worse:

* 80% are comatose
* ~60% die with HIE\
The **most common cause of death** is **withdrawal** of life sustaining **therapy**.


## Key Studies

* [BOX](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2208686)
	* 802 patients in admitted in 2 Danish ICUs following OOHCA with ROSC after 20 minutes and GCS <8
	* Oxygen arm:
		* Restrictive oxygenation (PaO~2~ 68-75mmHg) vs. liberal oxygenation (98-105mmHg)\
		Randomisation occurred in hospital, usually in ICU.
		* No change in mortality or neurological outcome
		* Unblinded
	* MAP arm:
		* MAP 77mmHg vs MAP 63mmHg
		* Protocolised therapy with fluids, noradrenaline, and dopamine
		* No change in mortality or neurological outcome
		* Blinded
	* All patients received 24 hours of TTM
