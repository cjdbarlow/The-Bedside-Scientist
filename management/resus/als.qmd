# Cardiac Arrest {#sec-arrest}

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

* ~10/100,000 admissions
* Majority are expected and occur without attempt at resuscitation


## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

Management requires identification and correction of **reversible** cause:

* Hypoxia
* Hypovolaemia
* Hyper/hypokalaemia\
* Hypo/hyperthermia
* Tension pneumothorax
* Tamponade
* Toxins
* Thrombosis
	* Coronary
	* Pulmonary (embolism)

## Investigations

## Management

### Basic Life Support

Pillars of basic life support:

* **D**anger
* **R**esponse
* **S**end for help
* Open **A**irway
* Normal **B**reathing?\
* Start **C**PR
	* 30 compressions:2 breaths
	* 100 compressions/minute
	* 1/3^rd^ depth of chest
	* Lower half of sterum\
	Above this is less effective, below has ↑↑ risk of solid organ injury.

### Advanced Life Support

:::column-margin
In a witnessed and monitored arrest, with **pads already attached**, it is **ideal** to perform **3 stacked** (repeated) **shocks** prior to commencing CPR.\
\
In a witnessed and monitored arrest, **without pads**, it is *reasonable* to perform a precordial thump.
:::


* A
	* Airway\
	Adequate airway for gas exchange is the goal. Attempts at securing a definitive airway may excessively prolong time without CPR or gas exchange, without improving survival.
* B
	* End-tidal CO~2~
		* Correlates with cardiac index
		* Allows detection of ROSC
* C
	* Attach **D**efibrillator
		* 200J biphasic or 360J monophasic
		* Anterior-Posterior pad position may be slightly preferable as it is less dependent on heart position


## Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

## Complications

* Death
* C
	* Ischaemic injury
	* CPR complications
		* Rib/sternal fractures
		* Solid organ injury
* D
	* Hypoxic brain injury
	* Seizures\
	In ~36% of patients after ROSC.


## Prognosis

In-hospital cardiac arrest has a surprisingly good overall prognosis:

:::column-margin
Neuroprognostication is covered under @sec-neuroprog.
:::

* Hospital discharge in 52%\
Multifactorial:
	* Early detection
	* Early arrival of ALS


Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest requiring ICU admission is significantly worse:

* 80% are comatose
* ~60% die with HIE\
The **most common cause of death** is **withdrawal** of life sustaining **therapy**.
