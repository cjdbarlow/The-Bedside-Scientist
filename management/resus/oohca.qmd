# Out-Of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Community cardiac arrest:

* 50-150/100,000 person-years

## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

Cause is commonly primary cardiac:

* STE 
If STE present, aim cardiac catheterisation.
* No STE  
Strongly consider cardiac catheterisation anyway, as 33% will have a PCI-treatable lesion.
