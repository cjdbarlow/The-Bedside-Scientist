# Cardiac Advanced Life Support

This section covers the algorithmic management of cardiac arrest in an adult patient who is **up to 14 days** after cardiac surgery.

:::column-margin
Key **differences** from **standard ALS** include:

* Environment\
Patients often:
	* In the ICU
	* Invasively monitored
	* Have epicardial pacing wires
* Therapy
	* If VF/VT: Reasonable to delay CPR for 1 minute to facilitate cardioversion
	* If asystole: pace DOO 100 at maximal amplitude
	* If PEA: Turn off pacing (exclude VF)
:::

## Epidemiology

Cardiac arrest post cardiac-surgery:

* Occurs in 1-5%
	* 50% within 3 hours of ICU admission
	* Majority within 24 hours

## Protocol

This algorithm assumes that the patient has ECG and invasive arterial monitoring:

:::column-margin
![](/resources/cals.png)
:::

* **Recognition**\
Arrest is consistent with:
	* Loss of central pulse
	* Loss of all invasive pressures
		* Systemic arterial pressure
		* Pulmonary arterial pressure
		* CVP
		* Pulse oximetry
	* Loss of ETCO~2~
* **Assess rhythm**
	* **VF/VT/Tachycardia**
		* DC shock\
		Up to 3 attempts.
		* Amiodarone\
		300mg. Further loading of 150mg followed by infusion may be given for refractory VT/VF.
	* **Asystole/Severe bradycardia**
		* Pace\
		In DDD or DOO at 100bpm and at maximal amplitude.\
		* Consider external pacing
	* **PEA**
		* Pause pacing to exclude underlying VF
* **Start BLS**\
External **Cardiac Compressions**:
	* *May* be delayed up to 1 minute to facilitate cardioversion, with the goal of ↓ trauma from chest compressions
	* Standard site, depth, and compression ratio
	* An SBP of >60mmHg should be targeted if invasive arterial monitoring is present
	* Inability to achieve an SBP of >60mmHg with compressions indicates need for **immediate resternotomy**
* **Prepare** for emergency **resternotomy**\
**Chest** should be **opened within 5 minutes** of arrest.

:::column-margin
Delay of chest compressions is appropriate to minimise iatrogenic trauma, and in recognition that it is minimally effective in obstructive and hypovolaemic causes of shock.
:::


**Adjuvant management**:

* Airway
	* Change to BVM with 100% O~2~
* Breathing
	* **PEEP to 0cmH~2~O**\
	Improve cardiac preload in the setting of tamponade/hypovolaemia.
		* Consider ↑ PEEP if arrest secondary to hypoxia
	* Auscultate/ultrasound to evaluate for **tension pneumo/haemothorax**\
	Decompress if present.
* Circulation
	* **Avoid adrenaline unless advised** by senior clinician\
	Typical dose is **50-300ug**.
	* Give fluid bolus
	* Activate massive transfusion
	* **Pause infusions**\
		* Evaluate for dosing/drug errors
		* Consider restarting vasopressor infusions
	* Lignocaine 1mg/kg may be considered as an alternative to amiodarone
	* **Change IABP** settings:
		* Pressure trigger
		* Maximum augmentation
		* 1:1 ratio
	* Consider echocardiography\
	Use should not delay CPR or resternotomy.



## Emergency Resternotomy

:::caution
Resternotomy occurring ⩽10 minutes is associated with ~50% survival, compared to ~10% if >10 minutes
:::

Integral part of arrest management, that should be:

* **Performed** in **all** patients **within 10 days** of their last operation
* **Considered** in patients **up to 14 days** after cardiac surgery
* Prepared for immediately upon identification of cardiac arrest
* Completed within **5 minutes** of arrest

### Indications

* Failure to achieve ROSC with above measures
* Immediately if SBP <60mmHg despite external chest compressions


### Equipment

Required:

* Scalpel
* Wire cutter
* Sternal wire holder
* Suction
* Sternal retractor\
e.g. Finochietto.


Optional:

* Dissection scissors
* Non-toothed forceps


### Roles

Six key roles (with ⩾7 staff):

* Team leader
* ICU coordinator/scribe
* Resternotomy team
	* Doctor
	* Nurse
* Resternotomy trolley\
Scout.
* Defibrillator/pacing
* Airway/breathing


### Process

* Cease chest compressions
* Remove sternotomy dressing
* Apply adhesive surgical drape **without prior** skin preparation\
Sterile chest compressions can occur at this time whilst equipment is assembled.
* Open sternotomy incision:
	* Deep incision through sternotomy sutures down to sternal wires with scalpel
	* Cut sternal wires with wire cutter
	* Remove sternal wires with wire holder
* Clear blood and clot
* Open sternum with sternal retractor
* Open pericardium if closed
* If no output despite opening sternum:
	* Consider internal defibrillation
	20J with internal paddles.
	* Commence internal cardiac massage
		* Avoid grafts
		* Right hand over apex and around behind the heart
		* Left hand over anterior surface of heart
		* Squeeze both hands together with flat palms and straight fingers\
		Aim SBP >60mmHg at a 100 bpm.

Post-procedural care:

* Transfer to OT
	* Washout
	* Consider closure
* Antibiotics
* Avoid fever\
Temperature ⩽36°C.
