# Hypothermia and Arrest


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors



## Pathophysiology

* Cardiac arrest secondary to hypothermia typically has a better outcome, even with prolonged resuscitation


## Modifications to Standard Life Support

BLS:

* Signs of life are obfuscated by hypothermia
* Mechanical (machine) CPR is preferred
* Intermittent CPR is permissible to preserve strength of pre-hospital staff when continuous CPR is not feasible\
5 minute breaks 5 minutely.


ALS:

* Use a low-reading thermometer to accurately record body temperature
* When core temperature <30°C:
	* Don't defibrillate
	* Don't give adrenaline
* When core temperature is 30-35°C:
	* Double the adrenaline dosing interval
* Rewarming should be performed:
	* 1^st^ line: Extracorporeal
	* 2^nd^ line: Warmed IV fluids and cavity lavage
	* 3^rd^ line: External warming
