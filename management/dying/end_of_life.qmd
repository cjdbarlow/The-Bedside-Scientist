# End of Life

Patients are ‘**approaching the end of life**’ **when** they are **likely to die within the next 12 months**. This may be due to:

:::column-margin
About:

* 1% of the total population die each year
* 30% of hospital patients are in their last year of life
* 80% of care home residents are in their last year of life
* 80% of people are admitted to hospital during the last year of life\
   * 24% have ⩾3 admissions
:::

* Advanced, progressive, or incurable disease
* General frailty
* Condition that predisposes to death due to a sudden or acute crisis


## Predicting Death

:::tick
Ask yourself: ‘Would I be surprised if this patient were to die in the next few months, weeks, days’?

:::column-margin
Most clinicians are overly-optimistic about prognostication.
:::

Accurate prognostication of life-expectancy is difficult and therefore fraught. A better approach is to:

* Recognise the uncertainty
* **Communicate** clinical **uncertainty** to the patient and family\
This can be done in a helpful way!
    * "While we don’t know exactly how long they may have to live, we do know that they won't get better. Our aim is now to ensure they are comfortable, and that you are supported.""
    A useful tool is to give an approximate range using common units, e.g.:
        * Long weeks to short months
        * Long days to weeks
* Identify patients approaching the **end-of-life phase**\
This allows for:
    * Better anticipation of likely care needs
    * Tailoring of care to patient's wishes
    * Fewer crisis admissions
    * Family and patients to plan for death


## End of Life Phase

The **end of life** is the period when a patient is **living with and impaired by a fatal condition**, even if the trajectory is uncertain or unknown. It is easier to identify patients who are approaching the end-of-their life.
