# Pressure Monitoring

Invasive pressure monitoring is an essential part of critical care, and aims to guide assessment of the delivery of oxygen to tissues.

## Pressures

Commonly monitored haemodynamic pressures include:

* Systemic arterial pressures
* Pulmonary artery pressures
	* PCWP
* Central venous pressure

### Central Venous Pressure

:::column-margin
The CVP, JVP, and RAP may vary in the setting of some pathologies, such as SVC stenosis causing SVC obstruction.
:::

The CVP is the pressure in the vena cava, and by extension the RA. The CVP is:

* Normally:
	* 0-5mmHg in the spontaneously breathing (well) person
	* <10mmHg in the positively-pressure ventilated person
	* Correlated with the PAWP\
	This relationship is often lost in illness. 
* Downstream pressure for the circulation
* The filling pressure for the right heart


### Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure

This is the left atrial back-pressure measured from the PAC tip when the balloon is inflated such that it fully occludes the vessel. The wedge pressure is:

* A surrogate for the LAP\
In absence of flow (because of balloon occlusion), there will be no pressure component due to resistance and therefore the measured pressure should be ~LAP. This assumes:
	* A continual column of blood between the catheter and the LA\
	Catheter should be in West Zone 3.
* Not measured routinely\
Routine wedging is the cause of much of the morbidity of PACs, due to the risk of PA rupture.


Measuring:

* Gradually inflate the balloon until the normal PAP waveform disappears and is replaced with a (rather damped) looking version of the CVP waveform


## Pressure Monitoring Devices

Arterial pressure monitoring evaluates:

* SBP\
	* Generally, the determinate of bleeding
* MAP
	* Determinant of perfusion for most organs
	* Least dependent on measurement site or technique
	* Least affected by damping
* DBP
	* Determinant of myocardial perfusion pressure

### Intermittent Oscillometric Blood Pressure

Detection of pulsation in a pneumatically inflated cuff over a proximal limb, which occludes and then reinflates to provide an indication of pressure in that vessel.

Pros:

* Easy
* Rapid
* Uncomfortable

Cons:

* Not always clinically appropriate
	* PVD
	* AV fistula
	* Lymphoedema
	* Skin and muscular injury
	* IV site location
* Inaccurate in dysrhythmia
* **Overestimates low pressures** and **underestimates high pressures**
* May lead to pressure injuries with repeated inflations


### Continuous Non-Invasive Blood Pressure

Bladder placed around a digit, which compresses the artery to a constant size (a volume-clamp). Arterial pulsation changes the volume of the clamp, which correlates to systemic blood pressure.

Pros:

* Non-invasive
* Continuous

Cons:

* No blood gas sampling
* Poor at detecting rapid changes in haemodynamic state
* Intermittent pause in monitoring to allow finger perfusion


### Invasive Arterial Measurement

Direct transduction of the pressure of a column of fluid that is connected to an intra-arterial catheter.

Pros:

* Continuous, accurate monitoring of pressure
* Gas sampling

Cons:

* Invasive
	* Painful
	* Infective
	* Positional
* Requires fluid infusion to maintain patency\
Usually 3mL/hr of saline (sometimes heparinised).
