# Pacing

Cardiac pacing refers to repetitive, low-current electrical stimulation of the heart to initiate and maintain rhythm. Pacing:

* Indications include:
	* **Bradycardias**\
	Generally symptomatic heart block or sinus node dysfunction, or asymptomatic with HR <40.
	* **Anti-tachycardia** therapy\
	Over-drive pacing of SVT (AVNRT, AVRT) and VT.
	* **Resynchronisation** therapy\
	↑ EF by coordinating LV and RV contraction.
* May be performed:
	* **Transvenous**
		* Permanent\
		Classic insertion of pacing leads via the SCV into the RA/RV.
		* Temporary\
		Flotation of a pacing catheter via a sheath for temporary emergency pacing.
	* **Epicardial**
		* Temporary\
		Temporary epicardial wires inserted during cardiac surgery. Usually deteriorate over 5-10 days.
		* Permanent\
		Occasionally permanent epicardial wires may be inserted during cardiac surgery (or via VATS) if venous access is compromised. 
	* **Transcutaneous**\
	Emergency pacing via pads. Requires sedation.

## Pacing Modes

A generic 3 or 5 digit code is used to describe pacing modes:

:::column-margin
Some examples:

* VOO\
Ventricle is paced, and there is no sensing. This is a (potentially dangerous) asynchronous mode.
* DDD\
Both atria and ventricles are sensed and paced. Atrial activity will trigger ventricular pacing if ventricular activity not sensed after an (adjustable) A-V delay.
* DDI\
Paces and senses both atria and ventricles. Atrial activity is not tracked (i.e. each chamber is dealt with individually).
:::

* **Chambers paced**\
A, V, D (dual, i.e. both atria and ventricles), O (neither).
* **Chambers sensed**\
A, V, D, O.
* **Response to sensing**
	* I: Inhibition\
	Pacemaker is inhibited by a sensed signal. e.g. VVI, ventricular pacing is inhibited by sensed ventricular activity.
	* T: Trigger\
	Pacemaker triggered by sensed signal.
	* D: Inhibition and triggering\
	Requires a dual-chamber system.
* **Rate Response**\
Only relevant in permanent systems. Describes if the pacemaker changes rate due to sensed change in metabolic demand.
	* R: Responsive\
	Responds to either movement or ↑ minute ventilation.
	* O: No response
* **Multisite pacing**\
Are multiple cardiac chambers paced:
	* O: None
	* A: Atria
	* V: One or both ventricles
	* D°: Any combination of ventricles

## Temporary Systems

Configuration of temporary epicardial and transvenous pacing systems:

* Default settings
	* Output: 10-15mA
	* Sensitivity:
	* Rate: ~10 higher than native rate
	Particularly prior to pacing check, to ↓ risk of R-on-T.
* Perform pacing check
* Managing failure to pace


### Pacing Check

:::caution
Full pacing checks cannot be performed if:

* The underlying rate is inadequate
	* Symptomatic hypotension
	* MAP <50mmHg
* Temperature <36°C
:::

Temporary epicardial systems should be checked frequently (at least once per nursing shift) to ensure capture and sensitivity thresholds and safe and functional. The full check requires:

* Preparation
	* ECG and BP monitoring
	* Explain to the awake patient that they may feel pre-syncopal\
* **Sensitivity testing**\
Test of the pacemakers detection of native cardiac output.
	* Set the pacing rate **below** the native rhythm
		* 20bpm below a regular rhythm
		* 30bpm below an irregular rhythm
	* Set the **output** of both leads to **0.1mA**\
	This activates both chambers but ensures that R on T will not occur as the output is too low to achieve capture. No pacing spikes will be visible on the ECG.
	* Check ventricular sensitivity threshold\
		* Start at the lowest value (0.8mV for the ventricular lead)
		* ↑ Sensitivity (mV) until the sensing light is no longer flashing, and the pacing light flashes instead. Then ↓ sensitivity until all native beats are sensed.
		This is the **sensing threshold**. The sensitivity *setting* of the pacemaker is set based upon this threshold.
	* Check atrial sensitivity\
	As ventricular sensitivity. Low atrial sensitivity is significantly less concerning than low ventricular sensitivity as there is no R-on-T risk.
	* Check ventricular capture threshold\
		* Set the pacing rate 10bpm **above** the native rhythm\
		* ↑ Output from 0.1mA until 1:1 capture is achieved\
		This is the **capture threshold**. The capture *setting* should be set to the **greater** of **double the threshold** or **5mA**, whichever is greater.
	* Check atrial capture\
	As ventricular capture.

### Failure to Pace

:::crisis
This can be an **emergency** in the pacing dependent patient.
:::

Escalation:

1. Ensure the box is connected
2. Press the emergency button\
Sets DOO at maximal output (usually 20mA atria, 25mA ventricular).
3. Connect the pacing box directly to the pacing lead (bypassing the connecting leads)
4. Replace the pacemaker
5. Institute transcutaneous pacing
6. Place a transvenous wire
