# Pacing

Cardiac pacing refers to repetitive, low-current electrical stimulation of the heart to initiate and maintain rhythm. Pacing:

* Indications include:
	* **Bradycardias**\
	Generally symptomatic heart block or sinus node dysfunction, or asymptomatic with HR <40.
	* **Anti-tachycardia** therapy\
	Over-drive pacing of SVT (AVNRT, AVRT) and VT.
	* **Resynchronisation** therapy\
	↑ EF by coordinating LV and RV contraction.
* May be performed:
	* **Transvenous**
		* Permanent\
		Classic insertion of pacing leads via the SCV into the RA/RV.
		* Temporary\
		Flotation of a pacing catheter via a sheath for temporary emergency pacing.
	* **Epicardial**
		* Temporary\
		Temporary epicardial wires inserted during cardiac surgery. Usually deteriorate over 5-10 days.
		* Permanent\
		Occasionally permanent epicardial wires may be inserted during cardiac surgery (or via VATS) if venous access is compromised. 
	* **Transcutaneous**\
	Emergency pacing via pads. Requires sedation.

## Pacing Modes

A generic 3 or 5 digit code is used to describe pacing modes:

:::column-margin
Some examples:

* VOO\
Ventricle is paced, and there is no sensing. This is a (potentially dangerous) asynchronous mode.
* DDD\
Both atria and ventricles are sensed and paced. Atrial activity will trigger ventricular pacing if ventricular activity not sensed after an (adjustable) A-V delay.
* DDI\
Paces and senses both atria and ventricles. Atrial activity is not tracked (i.e. each chamber is dealt with individually).
:::

* **Chambers paced**\
A, V, D (dual, i.e. both atria and ventricles), O (neither).
* **Chambers sensed**\
A, V, D, O.
* **Response to sensing**
	* I: Inhibition\
	Pacemaker is inhibited by a sensed signal. e.g. VVI, ventricular pacing is inhibited by sensed ventricular activity.
	* T: Trigger\
	Pacemaker triggered by sensed signal.
	* D: Inhibition and triggering\
	Requires a dual-chamber system.
* **Rate Response**\
Only relevant in permanent systems. Describes if the pacemaker changes rate due to sensed change in metabolic demand.
	* R: Responsive\
	Responds to either movement or ↑ minute ventilation.
	* O: No response
* **Multisite pacing**\
Are multiple cardiac chambers paced:
	* O: None
	* A: Atria
	* V: One or both ventricles
	* D: Any combination of ventricles

## Temporary Systems

Configuration of temporary epicardial and transvenous pacing systems:

* Default settings
	* Output: 10-15mA
	* Sensitivity:
	* Rate: ~10 higher than native rate
	Particularly prior to pacing check, to ↓ risk of R-on-T.
* Perform pacing check
* Managing failure to pace


### Pacing Check


### Failure to Pace

:::crisis
This can be an **emergency** in the pacing dependent patient.
:::

Escalation:

1. Ensure the box is connected
2. Press the emergency button\
Sets DOO at maximal output (usually 20mA atria, 25mA ventricular).
3. Connect the pacing box directly to the pacing lead (bypassing the connecting leads)
4. Replace the pacemaker
5. Institute transcutaneous pacing
6. Place a transvenous wire
