# Intra-aortic Balloon Pump


Assisted circulatory device consisting of an intra-aortic balloon which:

* Increases CO by 0.5-1L/min
* Provides temporary myocardial support as bridge to recovery or definitive treatment
* Acts via **counterpulsation** to improve myocardial supply:demand  
Deflates pre-systole and inflates during diastole, causing:
	* **Improved coronary perfusion**  
	Diastolic inflation ↑ DBP and improves coronary perfusion pressure and myocardial oxygen supply.
	* **Decreased afterload**  
	Pre-systolic deflation ↓ afterload and myocardial wall tension, reducing myocardial oxygen demand.


## Indications

* Reversible cardiogenic shock
	* Post-bypass
	* Post-MI
	* Severe IHD  
	Bridge to stenting or CABG.
	* Severe acute MR  
	Awaiting surgery.

## Contraindications

* Cardiac
	* AR
	* Tachyarrhythmias
* Anatomical
	* Aortic dissection
	* Severe peripheral vascular disease
	* Aortic aneurysm
	* Aortic grafts
* Other
	* Coagulopathy
	* Local infection
	* Sepsis
	* Lack of expertise


## Anatomy

## Equipment

* Catheter sheath  
Usually 7.5 Fr.
* Catheter balloon
	* 25-50mL  
	Size should:
		* Cover from L SCA origin to coeliac artery
		* Fill 90-95% of the aorta
		* Augmentation optimised when balloon volume equals stroke volume
	* Helium-filled  
	Low viscosity speeds inflation and smooths deflation.
* Console  
Contains pump, helium cylinder, and times inflation/deflation.

## Technique

Use:

* Setting ratio  
Proportion of augmented to non-augmented beats.
	* 1:1
	* 1:2
	* 1:3  
	Identical to no support.
	* 1:4  
	Used prior to removal. Increased risk of thrombus formation.
* Setting trigger  
May be:
	* ECG  
	May target from R wave.
	* Pacemaker  
	From pacing spikes.
	* Arterial  
	From arterial upstroke.
	* Internal trigger  
	In asystole.
* An optimised waveform
	* Measure at 1:2
	* Slope of augmented diastolic upstroke should be:
		* Straight
		* Parallel to augmented systolic upstroke
	* Augmented DBP should exceed unaugmented SBP
	* DBP at end of augmented stroke should be lower than unaugmented DBP by 15mmHg
* Anticoagulation
	* Practices vary
		* Heparinised saline through transducer
		* Low-dose systemic heparin
	* May not be required in first 24 hours

Optimisation:

* Optimising location
	* Balloon distal to L SCA, 2cm above left main bronchus
* Optimising timing
	* Should be performed in a 1:2 ratio

Weaning:

* Once inotropic requirements minimal
* Achieved gradually


## Complications

* Vascular
	* Limb ischaemia
	* Trauma
		* Dissection
		* Pseudoaneurysm
		* Vessel injury/rupture
* Device
	* Balloon rupture\
		* Gas embolism
	* Stroke	
		* Balloon thrombosis and embolism
		* Aortic atheroma dislodgement
	* Haemolysis
	* Infection	
* Use
	* Incorrect positioning
		* Mesenteric ischaemia
		* Failure of augmentation
