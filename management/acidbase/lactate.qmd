# Hyperlactataemia

Elevation in serum lactate >2mmol/L, which may be:

* Physiological
* Pathological


## Pathophysiology

Lactate is:

* Produced:
	* At ~0.8mmol/kg/hr
		* Predominantly by skeletal muscle (~40%)
		* Also skin/brain/gut/RBC
	* From pyruvate (via glucose and alanine)\
	This process regenerates NAD^+^ which allows further conversion from glucose into pyruvate, facilitating ATP production in absence of oxygen.
* Metabolised by:
	* **Liver**
	* Kidneys
	* Brain\
	Hypothesised use as substrate for ATP generation, particularly when neuronal uptake of ATP is ↓ as occurs in injury.

:::column-margin
An ↑ in brain lactate is associated with ↓ mortality.
:::

Lactate may be pathologically elevated by:

* ↑ Production
	* Tissue hypoxia (Type A)
	* Altered metabolism (Type B)
* ↓ Clearance
	* Hepatic dysfunction
	* Renal dysfunction

### Aetiology

Type A:

* Shock\
* **Mesenteric ischaemia**\
Although this is just localised ischaemia, it is important enough to be mentioned separately.
* ↓ O~2~ carriage
	* Hypoxia
	* Anaemia\
	Severe.
	* CO poisoning

Type B:

* Disease
	* Sepsis
	* Failures
		* Liver failure
		* Renal failure
	* Malignancy\
	↑ Anaerobic glycolysis, possible liver parenchymal destruction.
		* Phaeochromocytoma
		* Haematological
	* Thiamine deficiency
	* Diabetes
* Drugs
	* Catecholamines
		* Adrenaline
		* Salbutamol
	* Analgesics
		* Paracetamol
		* Salicylates
	* Energy sources\
		* Alcohols
			* Methanol
			* Ethanol
		* Sugars
			* Fructose
			* Sorbitol
	* Glycols
	* Metformin
	* SNP
* Inborn Error of Metabolism
	* G6PD


## Investigations

Bloods:

* Lactate\
This is by default L-lactate, which is the isomer produced by human metabolism. D-lactate is:
	* Not detected by standard assays
	* Produced by gut organisms
	* May be raised in:
		* Mesenteric ischaemia\
		Translocation through ischaemic bowel.
		* Short gut syndrome
		* Pancreatic insufficiency

## Management

:::caution
Treating an elevated lactate in isolation is generally unhelpful.\
\
An elevated lactate should prompt a search for evidence of systemic or regional malperfusion, and any underlying abnormality corrected to restore DO~2~.
:::

* Treat the primary disorder
* Correct acidosis\
Bicarbonate is reasonable if:
	* pH < 7.2
	* Disorder exacerbated by acidosis is present:
		* Pulmonary hypertension
		* Arrhythmia risk
		* High-dose vasoactives


## Prognosis

Hyperlactataemia is associated with:

* ↑ Mortality in sepsis/shock
Level is proportional to mortality; >4 is highly significant.
* ↑ Mortality in severe cardiac disease\
Post-arrest, post-CABG, AMI, heart failure.
