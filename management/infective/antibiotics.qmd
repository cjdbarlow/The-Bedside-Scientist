# Antibiotics

Principles of effective antibiotic use:

* Antibiotics:
	* Give as soon as practicable
	* Give an adequate dose
	* Give an appropriate course
	* Use empirical therapy until cultures return
	* Narrow spectrum once gram stain and culture confirm type of agent
* Blood cultures:
	* Before antibiotics
	* 2 sets
	* Not from an existing line
	* Do not have to be timed with fever
* Consider:
	* Infectious disease input
	* Tissue penetration
	* Clearance


## Concepts

Key concepts in antibiotic function:

* Minimum Inhibitory Concentration
* Kill characteristics
* Post-antibiotic 
* Treatment failure


### Minimum Inhibitory Concentration

The MIC is the **lowest concentration** of antimicrobial that will **inhibit visible growth** of an organism after **overnight incubation**. The MIC is:

* Reported as μg/mL\
A lower MIC indicates ↑ efficacy.
* Easily performed\
Usually automated, and therefore reproducible
* Affected significantly by:
	* Incubation time\
	↑ MIC with ↑ time.
	* Concentration of bacteria in sample\
	↓ MIC with ↓ concentration.
* Not a perfect surrogate for *in vivo* efficacy
	* Other factors besides MIC determine antibiotic effect
	* Antibiotic tissue concentration may be higher or lower than serum


### Kill Characteristics

Antibiotics can effect bacterial genocide in three broad ways:

* **Time-dependent** killing\
Efficacy dependent on the time that antibiotic concentration exceeds MIC, but not by how much.
	* Occurs when the drug only works at a particular point in the bacterial life cycle\
	e.g. Preparation for cell division.
	* Threshold effect\
		* Maximal effect reached at some proportion (usually 40-70%) of the dosing interval\
		Drug concentrations do not have to be over MIC continuously.
		* Affected by tissue penetration\
		Time over MIC is important only in the tissue where the infection is, which may not be in blood (where we measure concentrations).
	* Lend themselves to **dosing by infusion**
		* Benefits (at steady-state) include:
			* ↑ Time above MIC, which should ↑ efficacy and ↓ 
			* ↓ Peak concentration, which should ↓ toxicity
			* ↓ Nursing workload
		* Disadvantages include:
			* ↓ Concentration gradient driving diffusion into tissues
			* Most drugs are not *pure* time-dependent killers, and ↑ concentration still results in some ↑ efficacy
			* MIC is not known in early stages of treatment
			* Consumes a lumen continuously
		* May ↓ ventilator days without clear evidence of mortality benefit, with greatest effect seen in the critically ill
	* Examples include:
		* β-lactam
		* Carbapenems
		* Linezolid
* **Concentration-dependent** killing\
Efficacy dependent on how much antibiotic concentration exceeds MIC, but not by how long for.
	* Occurs when drug affects some critical component of bacterial infrastructure\
	* Greater effect with greater dose
	* Examples include:
		* Aminoglycosides
		* Metronidazole
		* Fluoroquinolones
* **Time and concentration-dependent** killing\
Efficacy dependent on both time over MIC and concentration above MIC.
	* Occurs for drugs which prevent synthesis of components for cell division
		* ↑ Concentration results in ↑ inhibition of relevant components
		* ↑ Time results in affecting a greater number of bacteria\
		As they won't all divide at the same time.
	* Examples include:
		* Fluoroquinolones
		* Azithromycin
		* Glycopeptides


### Post-Antibiotic Effect

The post-antibiotic effect describes bacterial killing that persists after the concentration falls below MIC. Post-antibiotic effects:

* Are an idiosyncratic feature of some agents\
Usually where the drug binds strongly to some part of the bacteria.
* Are **strongest** generally **for** drugs with **concentration-dependent** killing
* Have moderate strength for **time-dependent** killing

### Treatment Failure

Antibiotic treatment failure may occur due to:

* Wrong bug
	* Not susceptible
		* Viral
		* Fungal
		* Parasitic
	* Not infection
* Wrong drug
	* Resistant organism
	* Poor penetration to infected tissue
	* Bacteriostatic antagonism\
	Administration of a bacteriostatic antibiotic may ↓ efficacy of a bacteriocidal antibiotic, as cell division cannot be interrupted if it does not occur.
* Wrong dose
	* Too small
	* Too infrequent
	* Too short
* Wrong route
	* Inadequate oral absorption
* Source control
	* Incomplete surgical resection
	* Inadequate sputum clearance

: Pharmacokinetic Changes in Critical Illness

### Renal Failure

Adjusting antibiotic administration in renal failure is to **avoid toxicity** as efficacy is unaffected by impaired renal clearance. Drugs may require:

:::column-margin
In general:

* **Interval**-adjustment:
	* Aminoglycosides
	* Fluoroquinolones
	* Glycopeptides
* **Dose *or* Interval** adjustment:\
For drugs not particularly toxic in overdose either can be chosen, although interval adjustment is cheaper.
	* Beta-lactams
	* Carbapenems
:::

* **Dose adjusted**
	* Best for *both*:
		* Time-dependent *killing*\
		Time above MIC determines efficacy, but amount above MIC doesn't.
		* Concentration-dependent *toxicity*\
	* Maintains time above MIC, with ↓ dosing to avoid progressively ↑ drug levels when amount given exceeds amount cleared
* **Interval adjusted**
	* Best for *both*:
		* Concentration-dependent *killing*\
		Peak concentration should be 8-10 times MIC, but the time above MIC doesn't effect efficacy.
		* Concentration-dependent *toxicity*
	* Maintains the high peak concentration required for killing, but minimises concentration at other times


### Renal Replacement Therapy

Dose adjustment on RRT is similar to renal failure. In general, drugs can require:

* **No adjustment**\
Administration is unchanged due to:
	* Small free drug fraction
		* High V~D~
		* Highly protein bound
	* Hepatically cleared
	* Cleared by filtration\
	CRRT replicates glomerular filtration reasonably well, but not other forms of renal clearance.
* **Interval adjustment**\
	* Actively transported drugs\
	Renal clearance by tubular secretion is not replicated by CRRT, and so interval adjustment needed to ↓ toxicity.
* **Dose adjustment**\
	* Renally reabsorbed drugs\
	Drugs that are usually reabsorbed by the tubule undergo **increased clearance** in the kidney, and therefore require ***↑ dose*** on RRT.
