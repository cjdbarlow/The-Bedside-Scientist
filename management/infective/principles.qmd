# Principles of Antimicrobial Use

Cultures:

* Microbiological **specimens** should be obtained **before** commencing **antimicrobials**
	* Prevents false-negative cultures
	* Immediate Gram stain may guide therapy
* Interpretation of cultures depends on the site:
	* Sterile sites:
		* Include blood, urine, CSF
		* Cultured organisms are significant and indicate infection
		* Usually only one organism cultured, which is the causative organism
	* Non-sterile sites:
		* Usual commensal organisms are expected
		* Diagnosis of infection is clinical\
		Exception is cultured organisms that are definitively not commensal:
			* *Legionella*
			* TB
		* Microbiological results *guide* treatment
* Gram negative organisms become dominant with hospital admission
* The hallmark of an intravascular device infection (including CLABSI) is a continuous bacteraemia

True bacteraemia (or fungaemia) should be assumed with culture of:

* *S. Aureus*
* *E. Coli*
* *Candida*

An antibiogram is a summary of the **local** antimicrobial susceptibilities of different pathogens, and is important to determine choices for antimicrobial agent for both empirical therapy, and prior to receiving sensitivity data.
:::

Antimicrobials:

* Administer antibiotics **without delay**
* Choice of empirical antimicrobial should be based upon:
	* Site of infection
	* Community or hospital-acquired
	* Local microbiome\
	Understanding of the hospital or intensive care units antibiogram.
	* Patients previous microbiology results
* The narrowest-spectrum drug should be used\
Ideally empirical spectrum can be narrowed after **3 days**.
* Drugs eliminate susceptible organisms, at the cost of significant side-effects
	* Provide huge evolutionary advantage to resistant strains
	* Promote overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms
		* Including fungi
* Monotherapy is preferable to combination therapy\
Exceptions include:
	* Achieving adequate empiric cover
	* Treatment of polymicrobial infections with known sensitivities
	* Antibiotic synergy
		* Neutropaenic sepsis
		* Known bacteraemia
		* High (>25%) mortality
* Clinical response should be used to guide therapy\
	* *In vitro* sensitivity does not equate with clinical effectiveness
	* ***In vitro* resistance** is a **better predictor** than **sensitivity**
* A **>7 day course** is **rarely indicated**
	* Prolonged courses are associated with significant adverse effects
	* Exceptions include:
		* Immunosuppressed patients
		* Osteomyelitis
		* Infective endocarditis
		* Complicated bacteraemia\
		Require longer therapy and have ↑ mortality. Indicated by:
			* CNS involvement
			* Septic emboli
			* Multiple infected regions
			* Recurrent infection
* An adequate dose should be given\
Under-dosing leads to resistance.
* Serum levels of toxic antibiotics should be monitored for both toxicity and efficacy
* Recognise patients with **augmented renal clearance**, and ↑ dose accordingly

Empirical antibiotics are those given to cover *likely* organisms, rather than given in response to a known pathogen.

Inappropriate or delayed antibiotic use ↑ morbidity and mortality.
