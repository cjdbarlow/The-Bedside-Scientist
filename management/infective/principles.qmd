# Principles of Antimicrobial Use

Antimicrobial:

* Drugs eliminate susceptible organisms, at the cost of significant side-effects
	* Provide huge evolutionary advantage to resistant strains
	* Promote overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms
		* Including fungi
* Stewardship is a process of selecting antimicrobials to:
	* Optimise dose and duration
	* Minimise toxicity
	* Minimise selection of resistant strains 


## Antimicrobial Stewardship

Antimicrobial stewardship is the policy and practices of a healthcare institution to optimise antimicrobial use to improve patient outcomes, ensure cost-effective therapy, and ↓ risks of antimicrobial use. Principles:

:::column-margin
Empirical antibiotics are those given to cover *likely* organisms, rather than given in response to a known pathogen.
:::

:::column-margin
An antibiogram is a summary of the **local** antimicrobial susceptibilities of different pathogens, and is important to determine choices for antimicrobial agent for both empirical therapy, and prior to receiving sensitivity data.
:::

:::column-margin
Inappropriate or delayed antibiotic use ↑ morbidity and mortality.
:::

* Microbiological **specimens** should be obtained **before** commencing **antimicrobials**
	* Prevents false-negative cultures
	* Immediate Gram stain may guide therapy
* Administer **without delay**
* Choice of empirical antimicrobial should be based upon:
	* Site of infection
	* Community or hospital-acquired
	* Local microbiome\
	Understanding of the hospital or intensive care units antibiogram.
	* Patients previous microbiology results
* The narrowest-spectrum drug should be used\
Ideally empirical spectrum can be narrowed after **3 days**.
* Monotherapy is preferable to combination therapy\
Exceptions include:
	* Achieving adequate empiric cover
	* Treatment of polymicrobial infections with known sensitivities
	* Antibiotic synergy
		* Neutropaenic sepsis
		* Known bacteraemia
		* High (>25%) mortality
* Clinical response should be used to guide therapy\
	* *In vitro* sensitivity does not equate with clinical effectiveness
	* ***In vitro* resistance** is a **better predictor** than **sensitivity**
* A **>7 day course** is **rarely indicated**
	* Prolonged courses are associated with significant adverse effects
	* Exceptions include:
		* Immunosuppressed patients
		* Osteomyelitis
		* Infective endocarditis
		* Complicated bacteraemia\
		Require longer therapy and have ↑ mortality. Indicated by:
			* CNS involvement
			* Septic emboli
			* Multiple infected regions
			* Recurrent infection
* An adequate dose should be given\
Under-dosing leads to resistance.
* Serum levels of toxic antibiotics should be monitored for both toxicity and efficacy
* Recognise patients with **augmented renal clearance**, and ↑ dose accordingly

:::column-margin
True bacteraemia (or fungaemia) should be assumed with culture of:

* *S. Aureus*
* *E. Coli*
* *Candida*
:::


### Implementation

Components of a stewardship program include:

* Treatment guidelines tailored to local antibiogram
* Multi-disciplinary involvement
	* ID physicians
	* Clinical microbiologists
	* Pharmacists
	* Infection control practitioners
* Protocolised treatment of sepsis
* Approval for broad-spectrum and later-generation antibiotics
* Designated stop dates
* Mechanicsm for audit
