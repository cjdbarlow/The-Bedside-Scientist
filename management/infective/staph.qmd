# Staphylococci {#sec-staph}

Gram positive cocci that:

* Typically occur in bunches
* Culture well on enriched media\
e.g. Blood.
* All produce *catalase*\
Key distinguishing feature from Streptococci.
* Grouped by their ability to produce **coagulase**\
Enzyme which cleaves fibrinogen and leads to clot production. This clot also covers the bacteria in a film of clot, which protects them from immune detection and subsequent phagocytosis.
	* **Coagulase positive**\
	Confined to ***S. Aureus*.**
	* **Coagulase negative**\
	All the rest.


## Staphylococcus Aureus

Common skin commensal that:

* Causes illness by local infection and toxin production
* Generally requires host compromise to cause infection:
	* Skin breaks
	* Foreign body
	* Immunosuppression
* May lead to infection in:
	* B
		* HAP\
		Classically necrotising.
	* C
		* Infective endocarditis\
		May be associated with local abscesses if related to injection.
		* Invasive vascular devices
			* CLABSI
			* Pacemaker
	* D
		* Osteomyelitis
		* Discitis
		* Epidural abscess
	* E
		* Skin
		* Soft tissue infections
		* Joint prostheses

Staphylococcal toxic shock is a complication of *S. Aureus* colonisation, and is covered under @sec-toxic_shock.

### Methicillin-Resistant *Staphylococcus Aureus*

MRSA is a common mutation of *S. Aureus* that:

* Alters the Penicillin Binding Protein
* Significantly ↓ affinity of β-lactams for the cell wall so they become non-responsive
* Require treatment with a much more limited arsenal of antimicrobials


## Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus

Coagulase-negative *Staphylococcus*:

* Include several strains, the most common which are:
	* *S. Epidermidis*\
	IE, line infections.
	* *S. Saprophyticus*\
	UTIs.
	* *S. lugdunensis*\
	IE.
	* *S. haemolyticus*\
	IE.
	* *S. schleiferi*\
	IE.
	* *S. warneri*
	* *S. hominis*
	* *S. capitis*
* Usually exist as skin and nares commensals\
**Common** cause of **false-positive blood cultures**. **True infection** can be **distinguished** on:
	* **Clinical suspicion**
	* **Number** of **positive cultures**
	* **Differential time to positivity**
		* **Positive** culture in **multiple bottles** taken at the same time from different places\
		Classically peripherally and from existing CVC; if the CVC culture becomes positive first earlier it is more likely to be the source.
	* **Positive** in **aerobic** and **anaerobic bottles**\
	85% of "true" infections, compared to ~35% of potentially contaminated specimens.
	* Culture **positive** in **<16 hours**
* Cause infections in:
	* Areas obscured from the immune system:
		* Septic arthritis
		* Endocarditis
		* Invasive devices
			* Lines
			* Pacemakers
			* Prosthetics
				* Valves
				* Joints
				* VP shunts
	* Immunocompromised host
	* Disrupted barriers
		* Burns
* Are generally:
	* Multiresistant
	* Sensitive to glycopeptides and linezolid


## Investigations

**Bedside**:

* TTE\
For vegetations. Does not exclude IE, but can rule-in.
* TOE\
Should be performed if TTE is negative.


### Management

**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
	* **MSSA**\
		* β-lactams\
		Desensitisation for β-lactam allergic patients should be performed.
			* Flucloxacillin
			* Cefazolin
		* Clindamycin
		* Moxifloxacin
		* Vancomycin\
		Failure rates ~4× that of β-lactams. 
	* **MRSA**
		* Glycopeptides
			* Vancomycin
			* Teicoplanin
		* Linezolid 600mg IV Q12H\
		No dose adjustments required for renal or hepatic impairment.
		* 5^th^ generation cephalosporins:
			* Ceftaroline 600mg IV Q8H
			* Ceftobiprole 500mg Q8H
		* Daptomycin
	* **Coagulase-negative**
		* Vancomycin as empiric therapy
		* Flucloxacillin/Cephalosporin\
		May be appropriate de-escalation once sensitivity testing completed.
* Procedural
	* Source Control


### Prognosis

Mortality varies on site of origin, but can reach 50% with:

* Lung
* CLABSI
* Infective endocarditis
