# Antimicrobial Resistance

Resistance is the complete or partial loss of response of an organism to a certain antimicrobial agent. Resistance is classified into:

* Extensive resistance\
**Resistant** to **2 classes**.
* Multidrug resistance\
**Resistant** to **⩾3 classes**.
* Pan-resistant\
Resistant to all known agents.

Broadly, resistance may occur by:

* Enzymatic inactivation of antimicrobial
* Change to antimicrobial binding site
* ↓ Antimicrobial uptake
* Altered metabolic pathway that obviates antimicrobial action
:::


## Mechanisms of Resistance

### Inducible β-lactamase

ESCAPPM/ESCHAPPM are a group of **Gram-negative** organisms which:

* **Rapidly develop resistance** to β-lactam antibiotics
	* Due to **inducible β-lactamase**\
	Chromosomal-mediated cephalosporinase enzyme that is strongly selected for in the presence of β-lactam antibiotics.
	* May be inhibited by tazobactam, and so tazocin may be effective
* Should be **treated** with **non-β-lactam agents**, even if they initially appear sensitive
* Include:
	* ***E**nterobacter* spp.
	* ***S**erratia* spp.
	* ***C**itrobacter*
	* ***H**afnia* spp.
	* ***A**cinetobacter* and ***A**eromonas* spp.
	* ***P**roteus* spp.\
	Excluding *P. mirabilis*
	* ***P**rovidencia* spp.
	* ***M**organella morgani*


### Extended Spectrum β-lactamase

Describes organisms that develop a β-lactamase that also produces **resistance** to **other antibiotic classes**. The ESBL:

* Provides (variable) resistance to:
	* Third-generation cephalosporins (e.g. ceftriaxone)
	* Fluoroquinolones
	* Aminoglycosides
* Producing organisms include:
	* Enterobacteriae:
		* *E. Coli*
		* *Klebsiella* spp.
		* *Enterobacter* spp.
		* *Serratia* spp.
		* *Proteus* spp.
	* *Citrobacter* spp.
* Can spread by **plasmid transmission**\
Bacteria share chromosomal coding for the β-lactamase between organisms, resulting in rapid ↑ resistance in a colony.


### Carbapenemases

Organisms with enzyme that inactivates carbapenem antibiotics. Carbapenemases:

* Are produced classically by enterobacteriae, including:
	* *E. Coli*
	* *Klebsiella* spp.
* Include:
	* Klebsiella Producing Carbapenemase (KPC)
	* New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1)
* Can also spread by plasmid transmission


## Treatment of Multidrug Resistant Organisms

:::priority
* Determine **colonisation vs. infection**
* **Source control**
* Early specialist ID advice
:::

**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
	* Antimicrobial therapy
		* ↑ Dose to overcome MIC
		* Novel antibiotics
		* Combination therapy\
		Interaction of two antibiotics may overcome intrinsic resistance. Options include:
			* Add colistin
			* Add gentamicin
			* Use two drugs from the same class
* Procedural
	* Source control
* Physical
