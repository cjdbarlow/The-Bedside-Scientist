# Resistant Organisms

Resistance is the complete or partial loss of response of an organism to a certain antimicrobial agent.

:::column-margin
Broadly, resistance may occur by:

* Enzymatic inactivation of antimicrobial
* Change to antimicrobial binding site
* ↓ Antimicrobial uptake
* Altered metabolic pathway that obviates antimicrobial action

## Inducible β-lactamase

ESCAPPM/ESCHAPPM are a group of **Gram-negative** organisms which:

* **Rapidly develop resistance** to β-lactam antibiotics
	* Due to **inducible β-lactamase**\
	Chromosomal-mediated cephalosporinase enzyme that is strongly selected for in the presence of β-lactam antibiotics.
	* May be inhibited by tazobactam, and so tazocin may be effective
* Should be **treated** with **non-β-lactam agents**, even if they initially appear sensitive


### ESCHAPPM

The mnemonic refers to:

* ***E**nterobacter* spp.
* ***S**erratia* spp.
* ***C**itrobacter*
* ***H**afnia* spp.
* ***A**cinetobacter* and ***A**eromonas* spp.
* ***P**roteus* spp.\
Excluding *P. mirabilis*
* ***P**rovidencia* spp.
* ***M**organella morgani*


## Extended Spectrum β-lactamase

Describes organisms that develop a β-lactamase that also produces **resistance** to **other antibiotic classes**. The ESBL:

* Provides (variable) resistance to:
	* Third-generation cephalosporins (e.g. ceftriaxone)
	* Fluoroquinolones
	* Aminoglycosides
* Producing organisms include:
	* Enterobacteriae:
		* *E. Coli*
		* *Klebsiella* spp.
		* *Enterobacter* spp.
		* *Serratia* spp.
		* *Proteus* spp.
	* *Citrobacter* spp.
* Can spread by **plasmid transmission**\
Bacteria share chromosomal coding for the β-lactamase between organisms, resulting in rapid ↑ resistance in a colony.


## Carbapenemases

Organisms with enzyme that inactivates carbapenem antibiotics. Carbapenemase:

* Producing organisms include:
	* Enterobacteriae\
	Classically:
		* *E. Coli*
		* *Klebsiella* spp.
* Can also spread by plasmid transmission
