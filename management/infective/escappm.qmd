# ESCAPPM

ESCAPPM/ESCHAPPM refers to a group of **Gram-negative** organisms which:

* **Rapidly develop resistance** to β-lactam antibiotics
	* Due to **inducible β-lactamase**\
	Chromosomal-mediated cephalosporinase enzyme that is strongly selected for in the presence of β-lactam antibiotics.
	* May be inhibited by tazobactam, and so tazocin may be effective
* Should be treated with non-β-lactam agents, even if they initially appear sensitive

* ***S**erratia* spp.
