# Intracranial Pressure

## Indications

## Contraindications

## Anatomy

## Pathophysiology

Normal ICP waveform contains 3 peaks:

* P1\
Percussino wave from arterial pressure transmitted to the choroid plexus.
* P2\
Tidal wave due to brain compliance. P2 > P1 when brain compliance falls.
* P3\
Dicrotic wave from AV closure.

Lungberg waves are pathological waveforms seen rarely:

* Lundberg A waves\
Slow rise in ICP to very high (50-100mmHg) levels, occurring due to a fall in MAP/CPP leading to cerebral vasodilatation and ↑ ICP. Can be terminated by an ↑ in MAP and restoration of CPP.
* Lundberg B waves\
Changes in ICP by 10-20mmHg over shorter (30-180s) time periods, with associated change in respiratory pattern.
* Lundberg C waves\
Low amplitude changes in ICP that occur several times per minute.


## Management

:::info
Goal is maintain cerebral perfusion by targeting:

* **ICP <22mmHg**
* **CPP >60mmHg**
:::

**Resuscitation**:\

* C
	* MAP\
	Adequate CPP is essential.
		* Ensure euvolaemia
		* Vasopressors to ↑ MAP thereafter
		* If ICP is not measured, then target **MAP >80mmHg**
		* If ICP is measured, then target **CPP >60mmHg**
* D
	* ICP control

**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
* Procedural
* Physical

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:

### Intracranial Pressure {#sec-icp}

Control of ICP is based upon ↓ the volume of intracranial contents, namely:

:::column-margin
The principle of flow-metabolism coupling states that CBF is directly proportional to CMRO~2~. Sedation ↓ CMRO~2~, resulting in a ↓ in CBF, cerebral blood volume, and ICP.
:::

* Blood
	* Head-up positioning\
	↓ Venous pressure.
	* Avoid hypoxia\
	Target SpO~2~ >95%.
		* Supplemental oxygen as first line 
		* PEEP\
		Concern about ↑ ICP due to ↑ CVP, however adequate oxygenation takes priority.
	* CO~2~ control\
	Tight control aiming PaCO~2~ of 35-40mmHg.
	* Sedation
		* Benzodiazepine
		* Opioid
		* Thiopentone
	* Temperature control\
		* Target 36.5°C - 37.5°C
		* Maintain normothermia
* CSF
	* EVD\
	Drain to 10mmHg.
* Brain
	* Hyperosmolar therapy
		* Hypernatraemia
			* 3mmol ↑ in osmolality ↓ cerebral volume by **~7%**
		* Mannitol


## Complications


## Multimodality Monitoring

A variety of other intracranial monitors see use in specialist centres, although without much evidence supporting them. These include:

* Intraparenchymal oxygen content\
Invasive measurement of cerebral oxygen tension.
	* Normal 20-35mmHg
	* \<10mmHg associated with ↑ morbidity and mortality
	* \<20mmHg suggested as threshold for intervention
* Jugular bulb oxygen saturation\
Invasive measurement of cerebral venous oxygen saturation.
	* Normal 55-70%
	* Low levels suggested oxygen supply-demand mismatch
	* Elevated levels suggest hyperaemia or brain death
* Cerebral Microdialysis\
Invasive measurement of cerebral interstitial metabolic milieu via microdialysis probes.
	* Measurement of:
		* Lactate
		* Pyruvate
		* Glucose
		* Glutamate
		* Glycerol
	* Lactate and pyruvate used as markers of ischaemia
* Transcranial Doppler\
Noninvasive measurement of cerebral blood flow.
* NIRS\
Non-invasive measurement of cerebral oxygen saturation. Not validated in neurological intensive care.
