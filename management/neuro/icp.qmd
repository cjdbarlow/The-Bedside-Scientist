# Intracranial Pressure {#sec-icp}

## Indications

## Contraindications

## Anatomy

## Pathophysiology

Normal ICP waveform contains 3 peaks:

* P1\
Percussion wave from arterial pressure transmitted to the choroid plexus.
* P2\
Tidal wave due to brain compliance. P2 > P1 when brain compliance falls.
* P3\
Dicrotic wave from AV closure.

Lungberg waves are pathological waveforms seen rarely:

* Lundberg A waves\
Slow rise in ICP to very high (50-100mmHg) levels, occurring due to a fall in MAP/CPP leading to cerebral vasodilatation and ↑ ICP. Can be terminated by an ↑ in MAP and restoration of CPP.
* Lundberg B waves\
Changes in ICP by 10-20mmHg over shorter (30-180s) time periods, with associated change in respiratory pattern.
* Lundberg C waves\
Low amplitude changes in ICP that occur several times per minute.


## Clinical Manifestations

Clinical features of ↑ ICP include:

* Seizures
* GCS\
⩽12 is relative contraindication to LP without radiographic exclusion of ↑ ICP or hydrocephalus.
* Focal neurological signs
* Papilloedema


## Monitoring

ICP monitoring is indicated:

* For **salvageable patients** with **GCS ⩽8** and **TBI**, after resuscitation with:
	* Abnormal CT scan\
	Swelling, ICH, hydrocephalus, herniation.
	* Normal CT scan but ⩾2 of:
		* Age >40
		* Motor posturing
		* SBP <90mmHg
* Until ICP has stabilised and clinical assessment can be performed


Commonly used systems for measuring ICP include:

* Intraparenchymal transducer
* Intraventricular catheter
* Multimodality monitoring


### Intraparenchymal Transducer

Intraparenchymal transducers:

* Assess regional pressure
* Can be inserted at the bedside via small burr hole\
Ideally done in OR for sterility.
* Include:
	* Fibre-optic\
	Camino.
	* Strain-gauge\
	Codman.
* Accuracy drifts over time


### Intraventricular Catheter

Intraventricular catheters (EVD):

* Provide an assessment of global ICP
* Facilitate drainage and sampling of CSF
* More difficult to place with severe brain oedema and ↓ ventricule size
* Can be regularly re-calibrated\
Remain accurate over time.


### Multimodality Monitoring

A variety of other intracranial monitors see use in specialist centres, although without much evidence supporting them. These include:

* Intraparenchymal oxygen content\
Invasive measurement of cerebral oxygen tension.
	* Normal 20-35mmHg
	* \<10mmHg associated with ↑ morbidity and mortality
	* \<20mmHg suggested as threshold for intervention
* Jugular bulb oxygen saturation\
Invasive measurement of cerebral venous oxygen saturation.
	* Normal 55-70%
	* Low levels suggested oxygen supply-demand mismatch
	* Elevated levels suggest hyperaemia or brain death
* Cerebral Microdialysis\
Invasive measurement of cerebral interstitial metabolic milieu via microdialysis probes.
	* Measurement of:
		* Lactate
		* Pyruvate
		* Glucose
		* Glutamate
		* Glycerol
	* Lactate and pyruvate used as markers of ischaemia
* Transcranial Doppler\
Noninvasive measurement of cerebral blood flow.
* NIRS\
Non-invasive measurement of cerebral oxygen saturation. Not validated in neurological intensive care.

## Management {#sec-icp_mx}

Control of ICP:

:::column-margin
The principle of flow-metabolism coupling states that CBF is directly proportional to CMRO~2~. Sedation ↓ CMRO~2~, resulting in a ↓ in CBF, cerebral blood volume, and ICP.
:::

* Relies on ↓ the volume of intracranial contents, namely blood, brain, and CSF
* Involves **three tiers** of management\
	* **First Tier**:\
		* Avoid hypoxia\
		Target SpO~2~ >95%.
			* Supplemental oxygen as first line 
			* PEEP\
			Concern about ↑ ICP due to ↑ CVP, however adequate oxygenation takes priority.
		* 30° head-up **positioning**\
		↓ Venous pressure.
		* **Sedation** and analgesia
			* Benzodiazepine
			* Opioid
		* **Remove** hard cervical spine **collar**\
		If present.
		* **CO~2~ control**\
		Tight control aiming PaCO~2~ of 35-40mmHg.
		* **Normothermia**\
		Target 36.5°C - 37.5°C.
		* **Neuromuscular blockade**
		* **Drain CSF**\
			* Set at **10mmHg** with EVD
			* Should be vented continuously, not intermittently
	* **Second Tier**:
		* **Osmotherapy** ↓ cerebral oedema:
			* Mannitol 0.25-1g/kg
				* Creates an osmolar gap
				* Enters brain via damaged BBB, which may result in local ↑ ICP
			* Hypertonic saline\
			3mmol ↑ in osmolality ↓ cerebral volume by **~7%**.
				* 5-10mL 23.4%
	* **Third Tier**:
		* **Thiopentone** coma\
			* Profound ↓ CMRO~2~
			* Long half-life\
			Delays further neuro-prognostication.
		* Aggressive **hyperventilation**
			* Hyperventilation to hypocarbia does ↓ CO~2~ and ↓ ICP, but leads to cerebral vasoconstriction and ↓ CBF
			* Has a role for short term control of ↑ ICP prior to some definitive therapy\
			e.g. the patient who blows a pupil during transfer to the OR.
			* Should be **avoided** during **first 24 hours** of a TBI, as CBF is critically ↓ over this period
		* Decompressive craniectomy

:::column-margin
There is no evidence supporting mannitol or hypertonic saline over the other, however I prefer hypertonic saline due to:

* Repeatability
* Preservation of osmolar gap
