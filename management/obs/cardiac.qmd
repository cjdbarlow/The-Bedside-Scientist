# Cardiac Disease in Pregnancy {#sec-pregcardiac}

:::info
* Risk of pregnancy depends on specific disease and patients condition, individual counselling by experts is recommended
* Risk stratification is important, and even the lowest-risk patients still have up to 5% risk of peripartum
:::

Pregnancy is a:

:::column-margin
This describes the general management of the pregnant patient with cardiac disease. Management of peripartum cardiomyopathy is covered under @sec-peripartum_cm.
:::

* Significant circulatory burden\
Achieving a term pregnancy demonstrates presence of physiological reserve.
* Time where previously asymptomatic underlying cardiac disease is unmasked and diagnosed

## Epidemiology and Risk Stratification

Risk stratification can use:

* Risk prediction model\
Provides good general-purpose stratification for patients who may have very individual disease, and a spread of functional stratifications within their lesion.
	* ZAHARA
	* CARPREG II
* WHO Classification\
Comprehensive but may be less useful as does not stratify lesions by severity of that individuals pathology.



### CARPREG II

Predictors:

* General
	* Prior cardiac events\
	Includes:
		* Failure
		* Stroke or TIA
		* Arrhythmias
	* NYHA III/IV or resting SpO~2~ <90%
	* High-risk valve disease/LVOT obstruction
	* Mild or greater systemic ventricular dysfunction
	* No previous cardiac intervention
* Lesion-specific
	* Mechanical valves
	* High-risk aortopathies
	* Pulmonary hypertension
	* Coronary artery disease
* Care related
	* Late pregnancy assessment

### WHO Risk Stratification

Low (WHO I) risk:

* Cardiology followup limited to one or two visits
* Includes:
	* Uncomplicated or mild:
		* PS
		* PDA
		* MV prolapse
	* Repaired lesions
	* Isolated ectopics


Moderate (WHO II) risk:

* Require cardiology followup every trimester
* Includes:
	* Uncorrected ASD or VSD
	* Repaired ToF
	* Most arrhythmias


Moderate-severe (WHO II-III) risk:

* Classification depends on individual presentation
* Includes:
	* Mild LV dysfunction
	* HCM
	* Valvular heart disease that is not WHO I or WHO IV
	* Repaired coarctation


Severe (WHO III) risk:

* High risk of complications requiring *at least* monthly cardiology and obstetric review
* Mechanical valve
* Systemic RV or Fontan
* Cyanotic heart disease
* Other complex congenital heart disease
* Aortic dilatation:
	* 40-45mm in Marfan's
	* 45-50mm with bicuspid AV


### Contraindications to Pregnancy

:::info
These patients are also classified as Critical (WHO IV) risk.\
\
Pregnant women who will not consider termination require at least monthly review.
:::

* Severe Pulmonary Hypertension\
Mortality up to 50%.	
* Severe LV dysfunction\
NYHA III-IV or LVEF <30%.
* Previous peripartum cardiomyopathy
* Severe obstructive cardiac disease
	* HOCM
	* Symptomatic Aortic stenosis
	* Mitral stenosis
	* Pulmonary stenosis
	* Unrepaired coarctation
* Aortic dilatation:
	* ⩾45mm in Marfan's
	* ⩾50mm with bicuspid AV
* Severe coarctation


## Pathophysiology

Key conditions:

* Mitral stenosis is the most common lesion in the pregnant patient\
Poorer prognosis with decompensated disease, i.e.:
	* AF\
	May precipitate cardiac failure.
	* Pulmonary hypertension
	* May be treated with percutaneous commissurotomy 
* Marfan's syndrome\
	* Aortic dissection\
	Very high risk due to hyperdynamic circulation.
	* Requires monthly echocardiography
		* Aortic root dilatation >50mm strongly consider delivery
	* Vaginal delivery possible if aorta <40mm\
	Risk of straining leading to dissection.
* Pulmonary Hypertension
	* Highest risk is in the week following delivery

Consequences:

* Neonate\
Complications occur in 20-38% of women with cardiac disease, with key risk factors:
	* NYHA >II
	* Maternal LVOT obstruction
	* Smoking
	* Multiple gestation
	* Use of oral anticoagulants
	* Mechanical valve


## Clinical Manifestations

Assessment aims are to determine level of function:

* Exercise tolerance
* HR, BP, and SpO~2~
* Medical therapy\
With particular attention to:
	* Amiodarone
	* Warfarin
	* ACE-I/A2RBs

## Investigations

Key investigations include:

* Bloods
	* Haemoglobin
	* Coagulation status
* ECG
* Echocardiogram\
For any pregnant patient with new or changing symptoms
* Cardiac MRI


## Management

:::info
Highly complicated patients with extensive preparation required:

* Multidisciplinary approach
	* Anaesthesia
	* Obstetrics
	* Maternal-foetal medicine
		* Obstetric cardiology
	* Intensive care
	* Neonatology
* Tertiary centre
	* Adult ICU available
* Optimise underlying cardiac disease
:::

**Specific Therapy**:

* Procedural
	* Delivery\
	Generally planned for between **28-34** weeks.
		* Vaginal delivery
			* Preferred in:
				* Severe hypertension\
				Aim for a "stress free" labour.
				* Early epidural is recommended\
				Beware the fixed cardiac-output state.
			* Avoid in:
				* Aortic dissection
				* Marfan's syndrome with severe aortic root dilatation
		* Caesarian delivery:
			* Aortic dilation >45mm
			* Severe AS
			* Pre-term labour on anticoagulants
			* Eisenmenger's syndrome
			* Severe heart failure


### Anaesthetic Considerations

* C
	* Nature of lesion
		* Shunts\
		Required SpO~2~ and ETCO~2~.
		* Air embolisation
	* Vascular access
	* **Circulation goals**
		* Enhance pulmonary flow
		* Optimise CO
		* Optimise oxygenation
* D
	* Anaesthetic technique
		* Regional
			* Advantages
				* Partner in room
				* Avoids risks of GA
				* Allows slow titration of anaesthetic\
				CSE or epidural.
				* Better post-operative analgesia
				* Reduced blood loss
				* Reduced PONV
			* Disadvantages
				* Partner in room
				* Anticoagulation
				* Maternal anxiety\
				Subsequent CVS effects.
				* Complications of regional
				* Cannot give 100% oxygen
		* General
			* Advantages
				* Controlled situation
				* Reliable
				* Anticoagulation status not relevant
				* Reduced maternal anxiety
				* Easier invasive vascular access
				* Facilitate cardiopulmonary bypass or ECMO
			* Disadvantages
				* Airway and ventilation risks
				* Haemodynamic perturbation\
				Especially at intubation and extubation.
				* Effect of anaesthetic agents
					* Negative inotropy
					* Cardiac conduction abnormalities
					* Reduced SVR
					* Tocolysis
				* Risk of awareness
				* Greater blood loss
				* Poorer post-operative analgesia, PONV
* I
	* Endocarditis prophylaxis\
	Required in the setting of:
		* Unrepaired cyanotic CHD
		* Repaired CHD with prosthesis\
		In first 6 months.
		* Repaired CHD with residual defects	

:::column-margin
The technique chosen will usually come down to the risk-benefit evaluation of the patient, and the skill and preference of the team.

## Complications

Consequences of cardiac disease in pregnancy include:

* Maternal
	* Death
	* C
		* **Arrhythmias**
		* **Heart failure**\
		Uterine contraction results in mobilisation of uterine blood volume that may precipitate fluid overload.
	* D
		* CVA
	* H
		* Embolism
* Foetal
	* Death
	* SGA
	* Prematurity
