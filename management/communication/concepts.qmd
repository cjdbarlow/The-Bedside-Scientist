# Concepts

Hearing bad news and having complex conversations affects how people receive and process information. Consider:

General tips and one-liners:

* If a silence feels too long, consider a "content-free statement" - "I can't imagine how hard it is to hear this information."\
You can also ask - "Are you ready for more information?"
\
\
* "I want to see if I've done a good job explaining things to you. Would you mind telling me what you will tell the rest of the family?"

:::

* Avoiding **jargon**\
Even in titles - just say "Doctor". Simplify information.
* Keep messaging **consistent**
* Use **repetition**
* Keep things **concise**
* Use **silence**\
Ensure the rest of the team knows there will be long pauses.
* **Check in**\
	* How they are feeling with what is being said?
	* What are their concerns?
	* Ask them to summarise\
* Be **empathic**\
Often, questions may *seem* like a request for more medical information, but may actually just be existential distress ("What happens now?") and may be better served with kind words. More information can always be provided later.
* **Reflective listening**\
Restate what someone has told you, prompting them to continue.
* **Chunking**\
Deliver information in small packets, interspersed with silence for processing time.


## Responding to Emotion

Understanding and responding to emotions is critical. It is important to:

* **Recognise**\
Don't respond with information.
* **Identify**\
Avoid naming it too directly, generic statements ("This must be overwhelming for you.") are good.
* **Validate**\
Acknowledge and normalise it.
* **Explore** the concerns

## Cultural Humility

Culture, traditions, spiritual beliefs, and upbringing form an important role in guiding an individuals beliefs. Culture is important because:

* Medical needs are contextual and dependent, in part, on an individuals values
* Individuals may have many different cultural heritages that they feel different degrees of affinity and connection to\
This makes generalising the beliefs of a culture to a person potentially harmful.


Cultural humility is the practice of **suspending what you** (think) **you know** about a person based on **generalisations about their culture**.


## Use of Interpreters

Professional interpreters are the best available option, although bilingual staff are acceptable in low-risk situations. Family and friends should be avoided. Interpreters should be used when:

* Family requests
* When people cannot comprehend or respond to questions in English
* Stressful, complex, or unfamiliar situations
* When consent is required 

:::column-margin
Family may request **no** interpreter if:

* Feel their understanding is good enough
* Be embarrassed
* Know the interpreter
* Fear loss of privacy
* Be uncomfortable with gender/religious/ethnic background
* Worry about cost
:::

Using an interpreter:

* Consider discussing aim of the meeting with the interpreter prior\
Clarify the use of any technical terms.
* Introduce both yourself and the interpreter
* Make confidentiality explicit
* Talk directly to the family
* Avoid jargon
* Use silence and short packets of information
