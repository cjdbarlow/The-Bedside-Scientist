# Shared Decision Making

Shared decision making is a two-way conversation between healthcare staff and the patient and their family, aiming to develop a medical plan which is tailored to the patients individual values. Key aspects are:

* What is their **current life like**?
* **What is important to them**?
	* What do they enjoy doing?
	* What quality of life would be unacceptable to them?
* What is their risk appetite like? How much medical treatment would they be willing to undergo?

## Seven Steps

1. **Ask**\
What does the patient understand about their diagnosis?
2. **Explain**\
Fill any gaps in the patients knowledge of their disease.
3. **Explore**\
Get to know the patient as a person. Find out both:
	* Values
	* Functional state
4. **Options**\
Provide options to the patient, and discuss what the expected outcomes with each would be.
5. **Advice**\
Find out how much patients want to be guided by the medical teams.
	* ~75% of patients want advice from medical teams
6. **Agree**\
Find a plan that is suitable.
7. **Communicate**\
Disseminate the agreed plan to staff, patient, and family.
