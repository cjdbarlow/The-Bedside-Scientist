# Organ Donation {#sec-donorconvo}

Organ donation is a complex discussion that occurs at a particularly vulnerable time for families. Organ donation:

:::column-margin
This covers considerations when discussing organ donation with the family. Medical elements of organ donation are covered in @sec-organdonation.
:::


* Should not be raised prior to family understanding death or impending death
* Should be discussed with all families where it is a possibility
* Should be discussed with donation staff, *prior* to discussion with family
	* Any information contained on the organ donor register should also be communicated to family





Table 3.1: Elements that can be covered in the family donation conversation
Most people who receive a transplant benefit greatly and lead full and active lives as a result.
The process of organ and tissue donation is carried out with respect and dignity for all involved.
Donation is an option to consider and there is no obligation to donate.
The ICU and donation staff are available to discuss any issue family members may wish to raise before
making their decision.
Regardless of the donation decision, support is available for family members — this may be from hospital
staff, chaplains, social workers and donation staff, in accord with the needs and wishes of the family.

Table 3.2: Essential aspects to discuss with the family regarding donation after neurological
determination of death
Medical treatment of the donor will continue after death to ensure that the donated organs are in the best
possible condition.
The donor will go to the operating theatre on the mechanical ventilator with a beating heart, which will
stop during the donation surgery.

Table 3.3: Essential aspects to discuss with the family regarding donation after circulatory determination
of death
DCDD can only take place if death occurs within a specific timeframe.
The donation surgery needs to begin without delay after death to minimise possible damage to organs
that occurs during the time that they remain in the body without blood flow.
Medications will be given to the patient, as necessary, to relieve pain or anything else that may be
distressing to the patient or family (such as noisy breathing, seizures and abnormal jerky movements).
Predicting the time from treatment withdrawal to death is difficult. If this interval is greater than the
maximum that allows organ retrieval for transplantation, organ donation will not be possible. Tissue
donation may still occur if suitable and the family consents.
If organ donation is not possible, care for the patient will be continued in the ICU or another suitable location.
Before treatment is withdrawn, blood is taken to ensure the organs are suitable for donation and to match
the organs to potential recipients.
The family’s permission will be sought for the administration of medications and procedures to facilitate
organ donation (provided that these may be legally administered).
Families may change their minds and withdraw consent at any time.
