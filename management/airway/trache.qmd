: Factors to consider: Percutaneous versus surgical tracheostomy

:::

* A
	* **Surgical**\
	e.g. Laryngectomy.
* B
	* Prolonged **respiratory weaning**\
	To aid patients who are having a prolonged wean from conventional mechanical ventilation. A tracheostomy aids weaning by:
		* **↓ Sedation** requirements\
		Facilitates spontaneous ventilation, ↑ proportion of respiratory work done by the patient. May lead to ↓ total time on mechanical ventilation.
		* ↓ Work of breathing\
		↓ Airway resistance and (marginally) ↓ dead space relative to ETT.
		* ↓ Airway trauma\
		↓ Risk of laryngeal stenosis, vocal cord ulceration, and improves voice recovery.
		* ↓ Aspiration risk\
		Glottic competence is restored, so the tube cuff is not the only thing preventing aspiration.
		* Better secretion management\
		Awake patients can cough more effectively.
* D
	* ↓ Sedation requirements\
	Better tube tolerance and **patient comfort** compared to oral ETT.
		* Improved **communication**\
		Interaction, and use of speaking valve.
		* Facilitate **neurological assessment**
	* **Quality of life**\
* E
	* Facilitate **physiotherapy**\
	Positioning, rehabilitation, coughing.



## Considerations

Considerations for tracheostomy insertion include:

:::column-margin
**Timing** of tracheostomy insertion is difficult. In general:

* Clinicians are **bad at predicting** who will need a tracheostomy
* Routine early tracheostomy therefore leads to large numbers of unnecessary tracheostomies
* An approach:
	* Early if **prolonged ventilation inevitable**\
	e.g. GBS.
	*  **>10 days** following **mechanical ventilation**, without imminent extubation
:::

* A
	* Neck anatomy
		* Vascularity
		* Length of accessible trachea\
		Patients without much extra-thoracic trachea will be more difficult with both insertion and management.
	* Intubation grade
	* C-spine stability
* B
	* Respiratory function\
	Ideally:
		* FiO~2~ **<0.6**
		Risk of airway fire with electrocautery, and indicates tolerance of interruption of ventilation during insertion.
		* PEEP\ **<10cmH~2~O**
		Tolerance of de-recruitment and interruption of ventilation during insertion.
* H
	* Coagulopathy
* I
	* Infection\
	At site of insertion.


## Components

Components of the tracheostomy setup:

* **Tracheostomy tube**
	* Fenestrated\
	Tube has holes *above* the cuff.
		* Permits coughing, phonation, and **aspiration**\
		Outer portion needs to be blocked to divert gas flow via vocal cords.
		* Aids respiratory weaning
		* Patient must protect own airway
		* Improves swallow
		* Inner cannula can be:
			* Fenestrated\
			Allows tube to function as a fenestrated tube.
			* Unfenestrated\
			Blocks fenestration, which permits mechanical ventilation. Mechanical ventilation of a fenestrated tube results in significant circuit leak and a distressed, continually-exhaling patient.
	* Unfenestrated
* **Inner cannula**\
Inner tube placed inside the tracheostomy tube to prevent it being contaminated.
	* Easy cleaning\
	Just remove the inner cannula, clean, and replace.
	* ↓ Internal dimensions/↑ airway resistance\
	Degree depends on the catheter size.
* **Speaking** (Passy Muir) **valve**\
One-way valve that allows a patient to *in*spire through the tracheostomy, and then *ex*pire via the native away, allowing phonation. This **requires** the **cuff** to be **deflated**, or the patient will be unable to breathe
* Tracheostomy **cap**\
Occlusive cover for the tracheostomy tube, preventing inspiration via the tracheostomy tube, turning the tube into a partial upper airway obstruction. This requires the patient to inspire and expire via the native airway, and also the cuff to be deflated.





## Management

Caring for a tracheostomy tube:

:::column-margin
Tracheostomy patients are high risk and should be managed by trained staff. An ICU outreach team is beneficial.
:::

* A
	* **Cuff pressures**\
	Keep **<30mmHg** to reduce the risk of tracheal ulceration and stenosis.
	* **Clean**ing\
	Inner cannula (if present) should be cleaned when necessary.
	* **Suction**ing\
		* *Shallow* tracheal suctioning (to the length of the tube) to remove secretions, particularly if cough is inadequate
		* Suction channels (above the cuff) should be suctioned at least Q4H
	* Wound care\
	The wound must be kept clean to prevent infection.
* B
	* **Humidification**\
	Should be routine, including if patient is using trache hood or Swedish nose. Important for:
		* Patient comfort
		* Secretion management\
		↓ Viscosity.


## Complications

In-situ tracheostomy:

* A
	* **Dislodgement**\
	Risks include:
		* Patient
			* Agitation
			* Large s
		* Equipment
			* Poorly sized tube
		* Staff\
		Inadequate:
			* Training
			* Numbers
	* **Bleeding**\
	~5% of cases.
		* Early\
		Due to vascular injury.
		* Late\
		Due to erosion of the tracheostomy into a vascular structure.
			* Tracheo-innominate fistula\
			Erosion (classically of the *cuff*) into the innominate artery.
				* Risk factors
					* Procedural
						* Low insertion site or mediastinal tracheostomy\
						Innominate artery at level of 9^th^ tracheal ring.
						* Surgical tracheostomy
						* Hyperextension during insertion
					* Equipment
						* Over-inflated cuff
						* Anteriorly-curved tracheostomy tube
					* Patient
						* Poor wound healing
				* Leads to catastrophic:
					* Bleeding and airway soiling
					* Air entrainment
	* **Obstruction**
		* Bleeding
		* Secretions\
		↑ Risk if dehumidified.
* B
	* **Failure to wean**\
	If the patient is unable to wean from the ventilator despite the tracheostomy, this may be an unsatisfactory outcome for both patient and family.
	* Pneumonia\
	↑ Risk due to bypass of normal upper respiratory protective mechanisms. Occurs in **~25%** of patients.
* D
	* **Quality of life**\
	Generally worse in patients who have received a tracheostomy, compared to patients who did not.
* G
	* Swallowing difficulty
* I
	* **Infection**\
	Either of the stoma, or contamination of wounds (sternal, CVC) with secretions.


Post-tracheostomy:

* A
	* Tracheal **stenosis**\
	Commonly occurring (1-2%), rarely significant. Risk increased with:
		* Procedural
			* Tracheal ring fracture
		* Equipment
			* Oversized cannula
		* Patient
			* Male
			* Elderly
			* Prolonged duration of use
	* **Tracheomalacia**\
	Loss of tracheal cartilage (usually ischaemic), leading to collapse under negative-pressure inspiration.
	* Persistent stoma\
	May require surgical repair.
