# Tracheostomy Overview

:::column-margin
This covers the management of tracheostomies, including considerations for planning insertion. Procedural elements are covered elsewhere.

## Considerations

:::column-margin
Factors to consider with percutaneous versus surgical tracheostomy:

| Favours Percutaneous | Favours Surgical                      |
| --                   | --                                    |
|                      | Vascular insertion site on ultrasound |

:::


Considerations for tracheostomy insertion include:

* A
	* Neck anatomy
		* Vascularity
		* Length of accessible trachea\
		Patients without much extra-thoracic trachea will be more difficult with both insertion and management.
	* Intubation grade
* B
	* Respiratory function\
		* FiO~2~
		Risk of airway fire with electrocautery, and indicates tolerance of interruption of ventilation during insertion.
		* PEEP\
		Tolerance of de-recruitment and interruption of ventilation during insertion.
* C
* D


## Indications

* A
	* Surgical\
	e.g. Laryngectomy.
* B
	* **Respiratory weaning**
		* **↓ Sedation** requirements\
		Facilitates spontaneous ventilation, ↑ proportion of respiratory work done by the patient. May lead to ↓ total time on mechanical ventilation.
		* ↓ Work of breathing\
		↓ Airway resistance and (marginally) ↓ dead space relative to ETT.
		* ↓ Airway trauma\
		↓ Risk of laryngeal stenosis, vocal cord ulceration, and improves voice recovery.
		* ↓ Aspiration risk\
		Glottic competence is restored, so the tube cuff is not the only thing preventing aspiration.
* D
	* ↓ Sedation requirements\
	Better tube tolerance.
		* Improved **communication**\
		Interaction, and use of speaking valve.
		* Neurological assessment
* E
	* Facilitate **physiotherapy**\
	Positioning, rehabilitation, coughing.


## Contraindications

## Management

Caring for a tracheostomy tube:

* A
	* **Cuff pressures**\
	Keep **<30mmHg** to reduce the risk of tracheal ulceration and stenosis.
* B
	* **Humidification**\
	Important for:
		* Patient comfort
		* Secretion management\
		↓ Viscosity.



## Complications

In-situ tracheostomy:

* A
	* **Dislodgement**\
	Risks include:
		* Patient
			* Agitation
			* Large s
		* Equipment
			* Poorly sized tube
		* Staff\
		Inadequate:
			* Training
			* Numbers
	* **Bleeding**\
		* Early\
		Due to vascular injury.
		* Late\
		Due to erosion of the tracheostomy into a vascular structure.
			* Tracheo-innominate fistula\
			Erosion (classically of the *cuff*) into the innominate artery.
				* Risk factors
					* Procedural
						* Low insertion\Mediastinal tracheostomy\
						Innominate artery at level of 9^th^ tracheal ring.
						* Surgical tracheostomy
						* Hyperextension during insertion
					* Equipment
						* Over-inflated cuff
						* Anteriorly-curved tracheostomy tube
					* Patient
						* Poor wound healing
				* Leads to catastrophic:
					* Bleeding and airway soiling
					* Air entrainment
	* **Obstruction**
		* Bleeding
		* Secretions
* B
	* **Failure to wean**\
	If the patient is unable to wean from the ventilator despite the tracheostomy, this may be an unsatisfactory outcome for both patient and family.
	* Blockage with **secretions**\
	↑ Risk if dehumidified.
	* Pneumonia\
	↑ Risk due to bypass of normal upper respiratory protective mechanisms. Occurs in **~25%** of patients.
* D
	* **Quality of life**\
	Generally worse in patients who have received a tracheostomy, compared to patients who did not.
* G
	* Swallowing difficulty
* I
	* **Infection**\
	Either of the stoma, or contamination of wounds (sternal, CVC) with secretions.


Post-tracheostomy:

* A
	* Tracheal **stenosis**\
	Commonly occurring, rarely significant. Risk increased with:
		* Procedural
			* Tracheal ring fracture
		* Equipment
			* Oversized cannula
		* Patient
			* Male
			* Elderly
			* Prolonged duration of use
	* **Tracheomalacia**\
	Loss of tracheal cartilage (usually ischaemic), leading to collapse under negative-pressure inspiration.
	* Persistent stoma\
	May require surgical repair.
