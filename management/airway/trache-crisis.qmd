# Tracheostomy Crises

## Loss of Airway



## Tracheo-Innominate Fistula

:::danger
This is a **crisis**. Priorities are:

* Control haemorrhage and reduce airway soiling\
Methods:
	* **Overinflate** the **tracheostomy cuff**\
	* **Intubate** from above\
	May not be an option if the patient has had the laryngectomy.
	* Digital compression
* Call a **surgeon**
:::

Fistula between trachea and innominate artery, causing catastrophic:

* Airway soiling with arterial haemorrhage
* Air entrainment and embolism

:::column-margin
The **Utley Manouvre** involves digital compressing the innominate artery against the manubrium to reduce bleeding.

* Place finger through stoma
* Blunt dissect *proximal* to the tracheal wall to create a plane between the trachea and the innominate artery
* Compress artery against manubrium
