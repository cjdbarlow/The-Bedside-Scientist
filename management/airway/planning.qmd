# Airway Planning

> * Oxygenation > Intubation
> * Optimise before you compromise
> * Awake intubation should be considered in the presence of predictors of difficult airway management

The goal of airway management is to **maintain oxygenation and ventilation, without physiological compromise or complications**, ideally with a patent and protected airway.
* This does not (necessarily) imply intubation  
Oxygen can be delivered by:
	* Ventilation
	* Insufflation
	* Apnoeic absorption
* The chosen airway management technique will depend on the patients anatomy and physiological state, the situation, and the indication
* Secondary goals include:
	* Airway protection  
	From aspiration.
	* Airway security  
	From dislodgement or obstruction.
	* Ventilation  
	For acidosis.
	* Control of airway pressures
	* Control of respiratory timing
* Remember the hierarchy of intubation needs

## Epidemiology of Airway Complications

* The most common cause of airway related death is hypoxia
	* Aspiration is the most common cause of airway related anaesthetic death
* Complications from airway management are more common in ED and ICU


* Failed tracheal intubation occurs in:
	* ~1/1000-2000 elective cases 
	* ~1/250 obstetric RSI
	* ~1/100 ED intubations
* Failed or difficult tracheal intubation was the primary event in >1/3<sup>rd</sup> of events


* CICO occurs in ~1/50,000 elective anaesthetics
	* CICO is low compared to incidence of difficult intubation
* CICO contributes 25% of anaesthesia-related mortality
* Requirement for emergency FONA increases morbidity 15x  
	* ~25% permanent harm or death
* In 2/3<sup>rds</sup> of CICO situations, a surgical airway was performed too late to prevent harm  

## Factors Contributing to Adverse Airway Events

* Human factors  
Human failures occur in ~80% of airway events.
	* Delayed decision to declare failed airway
	* Delay in decision to perform cricothyrotomy
	* Equipment knowledge
	* Training  
	Especially in surgical airway and rescue techniques.
	* Poor communication
	* Poor teamwork
	* Tunnel vision/task focus
	* Training
	* Systems
* Patient Factors
	* Obesity


Important technical factors include:

* Make the **first attempt** the **best attempt**
	* Subsequent attempts are less successful
	* Efficacy of SAD rescue is reduced with more attempts
* Equipment and technique
	* Selection of laryngoscopes, and experience in their use
	* Bougie  
	Pre-shaped.
	* ELM
	* Remove cricoid pressure if view is poor
* **Call for help early**
* Maximum of **3 attempts** by a single provider


## A Framework for Airway Management

> There are many frameworks for airway management. This one aims to:
>	* Focus on a general plan but not on any specific technique
>	* Provide an approach that is appropriate for elective anaesthesia as well as emergency airway management
>	* Plan for and avoid the difficult airway
>	* In the patient who does not require *immediate* intubation





1. **Plan**
	* Evaluate what techniques are available  
	Based on the equipment, the patient, and technical skills. Think **ACORNS**: 
		* **A**wake
			* Waking the patient
			* Awake laryngoscopy
			* Awake FOI  
			Is there laryngeal or tracheal pathology?
		* **C**ricoid/FONA
			* Scalpel cricothyrotomy
			* Needle cricothyrotomy
		* **Or**al
			* Mask ventilation
			* Intubation  
			With and without VL.
		* **N**asal  
		Is the oral route impossible?
			* Intubation  
			Including blind.
		* **S**upraglotic
			* Use of LMA
			* Use of iLMA
	* For *this* patient, **consider which techniques are**:
		* **Preferred**  
		Depending on the indication for airway management. In most critical care situations (compared to elective anaesthesia), this will be a definitive oral airway.
		* **Feasible**  
		Could be used to maintain oxygenation +/- ventilation, but may not necessarily be definitive.
		* **Unfeasible**  
		Certain techniques may not be appropriate in certain patients.
	* Of this short-list of options, decide on a **hierarchy of techniques**  
	**Plan for failure** and have a series of **identified rescue techniques**, including a plan for:
		* Rescue ventilation  
		Alternate device, e.g. LMA, iLMA.
		* Rescue intubation  
		Alternate device.
	* Consider **which drugs** will be required for these techniques


2. **Patient**  
Adequate patient preparation prior to induction reduces incidence of difficult tracheal intubation. Think **PROC**:

* **Positioning**  
	* Ensure EAM is level with sternal notch to maximise ease of intubation
	* Ramping increases FRC in the obese patient
* **Recruitment**  
Use of CPAP during preoxygenation prolongs safe apnoea time in obese patients.
* **Oxygenate**  
Involves adequate denitrogenation, and consideration of apnoeic oxygenation.
	* **Preoxygenation**/denitrogenation  
	EtO<sub>2</sub> > 80% indicates a good proportion of FRC is oxygen, significantly prolonging safe apnoea times from 1-2 minutes up to 8 minutes.
		* Note that reduced FRC (e.g. atelectasis) will lead to shunt and rapid drop in SpO<sub>2</sub> despite a high ETO<sub>2</sub> fraction  
		Significant shunt will result in an SpO<sub>2</sub> of < 100% despite adequate ETO<sub>2</sub>.
		* This can only be achieved when breathing oxygen through a closed-circuit system
	* **Apnoeic oxygenation**  
	Delivery of oxygen via nasal cannula during the apnoeic period. This technique:
		* Requires a patent airway  
		May not help during the apnoeic period when airway tone is reduced.
		* May be performed with:
			* Standard nasal cannula from wall oxygen at 15L.min<sup>-1</sup>
			* Humidified 
		* May be useful when:
			* Oxygenation/FRC is compromised
			* Laryngoscopy is difficult


3. **Perform**
	* Complete pre-airway management checklist  
	During pre-oxygenation periods.
	* Begin!


### Airway Management Mental Checklist

The **SPEEDBOMB** checklist is:

*  Easy to remember  
Allows it to be used as a 'challenge-confirm' checklist - i.e. the steps can be performed by multiple providers simultaneously and then the checklist is used to verify tasks have been completed
* Appropriate to be used by a single provider as a 'call-do-response' checklist when working with an unfamiliar team


* **Suction**  
	* Available
	* Consider gastric drainage if NGT is in situ
* **Position**  
In optimal position for this particular technique.
	* Ear-to-sternal notch
* **End-tidal CO<sub>2</sub>**  
Available and working.
* **Equipment**  
The kit needed for the chosen techniques.
	* BVM  
	With mask and PEEP valve.
	* Airway adjuncts  
	NPA and OPA available.
	* Laryngoscope
		* Two working laryngoscopes
		* **Lubricated**  
		Critically ill patients often have high sympathetic tone and a dry oropharynx, making advancement of an unlubricated blade down the tongue difficult.
		* Appropriate sized blades
	* LMA  
	Lubed and inflated as desired.
	* ETT  
		* Of **appropriate size**
		* Lubricated
		* At least two, including a smaller one
		* If concerned about upper airway pathology/burns, have a **size 6 available**
	* Adjuncts to ETT
		* **Bougie**  
		Must always be available.
		* Stylet
		* Syringe  
		For cuff inflation.
* **Drugs**  
Including desired dose.
	* Induction agents  
	* Muscle relaxant  
	If concerned, always use **adequate doses** of a **rapid-onset** NMBD.
	* Opioid
	* Vasopressors
* **Backup plan**  
Double check the availability of backup equipment, including FONA equipment.
* **Oxygen** 
	* Supply present **and connected**  
	Ensure that the oxygen tubing attached to the flowmeter is also attached to the patient.
	* Adequate pre-oxygenation/denitrogenation period
	* Use of PEEP for lung recruitment prior to induction
* **Monitoring**
	* ECG
	* SpO<sub>2</sub>
	* BP
* **Briefing**
	* Allocate roles
	* Detail airway plan A, B, etc
	* Declare at what points the airway management strategy will change  
	e.g. "If the SpO<sub>2</sub> falls to less than 93%, I will cease intubation attempts and return to BVM. If unable to mask ventilate, I will place an LMA."
