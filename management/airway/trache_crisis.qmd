## Tracheo-Innominate Fistula

Fistula between trachea and innominate artery occurring due to erosion from the tracheostomy tube or cuff, leading to catastrophic:

:::column-margin
The **Utley Manouvre** involves digital compressing the innominate artery against the manubrium to reduce bleeding.

* Place finger through stoma\
This may require lateral and inferior extension of the incision to gain access. Consider inserting a Foley catheter as an alternative.
* Blunt dissect *anterior* to the tracheal wall to create a plane between the trachea and the innominate artery
* Compress artery against manubrium\
Artery can be identified by pulsation.

* Airway soiling with arterial haemorrhage
* Air entrainment and embolism
* Death\
In over **90%** of cases.

:::crisis
Tracheo-innominate fistula is a **crisis**. Priorities are:

* Control haemorrhage and reduce airway soiling\
Methods:
	* **Overinflate** the **tracheostomy cuff**
	* **Intubate** from above\
	May not be an option if the patient has had the laryngectomy.
	* Digital compression
* Call a **surgeon**

:::

A tracheo-innominate fistula is:

* **Rare**, ~0.1-1%
* Occurs between 3 days and 6 weeks following insertion\
Peak incidence 7-14 days.
* Associated with various risk factors:
	* Procedural
		* Low insertion site or mediastinal tracheostomy\
		Innominate artery at level of 9^th^ tracheal ring.
		* Surgical tracheostomy
		* Hyperextension during insertion
	* Equipment
		* Over-inflated cuff
		* Anteriorly-curved tracheostomy tube
	* Patient
		* Poor wound healing
* Proceeded by a **herald bleed** in **50%** of cases^[This [terrifying case report](https://casereports.bmj.com/content/12/12/e232257) begins:\
"Thirty days following the insertion of the original tracheostomy, small amounts of blood-stained secretions and tracheal aspirates were noted for the first time.\
\
Later that evening, spontaneous massive haemorrhage via the tracheostomy stoma, the tracheostomy tube and the mouth occurred."]
				


Definitive management will be **surgical**:

* May require a sternotomy, and cardiac surgery involvement
* The innominate artery will usually be ligated due to the high risk of recurrent bleeding
* Stenting the innominate *may* be an option, but is centre and skill-mix dependent
* Aim SBP 120-140 post-operatively to minimising rebleeding
