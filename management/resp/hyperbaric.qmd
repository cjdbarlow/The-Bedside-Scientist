# Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy

The use of a pressure chamber to deliver greater-than-atmospheric partial pressures of gas, in particular oxygen. This significantly ↑ the partial pressure of oxygen dissolved in plasma.

Delivered therapy varies on:

* The chamber
    * Monoplace\
    Single-occupant. Usually completely filled with the breathable gas.
    * Multiplace\
    Multiple person chamber. Oxygen hoods are usually used (rather than filling the chamber) to reduce fire risk.


## Indications

* Decompressive Injury
* CO~2~ toxicity\
CO binds Hb with significantly greater affinity than O~2~.
    * ↑ PaO~2~ reduces the half-life of CO:
        * Air: 320 minutes
        * 100% FiO2~2~: 90 minutes
        * 3 atm: 23 minutes
    * This is worthwhile in:
        * Age >35
        * Syncope
        * COHb >25%\
* Necrotising soft tissue infections
* Non-healing wounds
