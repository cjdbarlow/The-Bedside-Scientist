# Non-Invasive Ventilation

Mechanical ventilatory support delivered without an ETT, usually via delivery of positive pressure to the airway. Any invasive mode of ventilation can be given non-invasively:

:::column-margin
The oldest form of NIV is negative-pressure, and is the iron lung.
:::

* CPAP\
Administration of a single pressure throughout the respiratory cycle.
* PSV\
Administration of pressure that is provided only when inspiratory flow is detected.
* Bilevel/Bipap\
Combination of CPAP and PSV.


## Indications

Acute:

* Reversible respiratory failure
    * APO\
    ↓ LV afterload and ↑ recruitment.
        * CPAP \~10cmH~2~O ideal in most
    * T2RF in COAD\
    ↓ Mortality and need for intubation, and re-intubation when extubated onto CPAP.
        * CPAP appropriate for reversible obstruction
        * Bilevel/PSV (5-20cmH~2~O) for hypercarbia
        * Mask intolerance higher for COAD than APO
    * Asthma
    * Pneumonia\
    May be preferred in immunosuppressed patients or other groups with very poor outcomes from mechanical ventilation. 
    * Post-operative
    * Chest wall trauma
    
    
Chronic:

* OSA
* Neuromuscular disease

## Contraindications

* Obtundation\
Risk of aspiration with an unprotected airway.
* Dyssynchrony\
Patient discomfort or poor mask fit may lead to leaking and failure of pressure to augment appropriately.
* Inability to clear secretions

## Continuous Positive Airway Pressure

Applies an unchanging positive pressure throughout the respiratory cycle, leading to:

* ↓ Work of breathing\
↓ Elastic work by ↑ alveolar recruitment. ↓ Inspiratory threshold work of breathing if iPEEP is ↑.
* ↑ SpO~2~\
Via alveolar recruitment.
* ↓ LV afterload


## Pressure Support Ventilation

Inspiration is detected via a flow or pressure trigger, and a positive airway pressure is provided which:

* ↑ Vt\
Leads to ↑ Va and ↓ PaCO~2~.
* ↓ elastic and resistive work of breathing
* Induces pulmonary surfactant release
