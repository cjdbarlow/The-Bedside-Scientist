# Recruitment {#sec-recruit}

A recruitment manoeuvre is a **sustained, transient ↑** in **airway pressure** above normal tidal ventilation pressure, and sustained beyond a normal inspiratory time, which aims to open collapsed alveoli and small airways so they are able to participate in gas exchange.


## Indications

Hypoxaemia with evidence of recruitable lung:

* Clinical suggestion of collapse
	* Post-intubation
	* Post-bronchoscopy
* Radiographically recruitable lung\
Evidence of volume loss implying collapse rather than consolidation.
* PEEP-responsive ARDS\
How to identify this subgroup remains unclear.


## Contraindications

* High risk of barotrauma:
	* Bullous lung disease
	* Previous PTHx
	* Current PTHx
* CVS instability


## Principles

Lung parenchyma collapses in a heterogenous fashion. Alveoli:

* Open when pressure exceeds the critical opening pressure
* Collapse when pressure falls below critical closing pressure
	* Critical closing pressure is *less* than the critical opening pressure\
	Application of PEEP above the critical closing pressure keeps alveoli open.
* Will tend to distribute pressure *first* to well-aerated lung\
This may lead to over-distention of healthy lung, prior to recruitment of lung units with poor compliance

Recruitment manoeuvres:

* Are cheap
* Have been shown to improve:
	* Oxygenation
	* Gas exchange
	* Inflammatory markers
* Are described with a wide variety of techniques:
	* 30cmH~2~O for 30-60s\
	Safe, moderately effective.
	* 40cmH~2~O for 40s
	* Pip at 50cmH~2~O, aiming PEEP above the upper inflection point on the pressure-volume loop
	* Titration of Pip up to 40cmH~2~O
	* Staircase recruitment

## Practice

Appropriate in **carefully selected** patients. Considerations:

* High chance of recruitable lung
* Low risk of harm
* Recruitment strategy
	* I have found 30cmH~2~O for 60s or 40cmH~2~O for 40s, abandoning if hypotension or hypoxia result, to be safe and effective
	* My experience with staircase recruitment is that it causes significant haemodynamic instability without much additional benefit in oxygenation


## Complications

Risks relate to significant ↑ airway pressure:

* Requires sedation/paralysis
* Barotrauma
	* Pneumothorax
	* Pneumomediastinum
	* Cyclic atelectasis\
	Re-collapse after cessation of recruitment.
* Cardiovascular instability	
	* ↑↑ RV afterload
	* ↓ VR
