# Ventilator Weaning

Separation from mechanical ventilation should occur once the initial process that required ventilation has resolved. Suitability for weaning is indicated by adequate:

* Strength\
    * To achieve a spontaneous breath\
    VC >10mL/kg with Psupp of 5cmH~2~O
    * To clear secretions
* Oxygenation\
Normoxia with low PEEP (<8cmH~2~O) and FiO~2~ (<40%) requirements.
* Work of breathing\
Can be assessed:
    * Clinically\
    Gestalt is effective, with a reintubation rate of ~3%.
    * Rapid Shallow Breathing Index\
    Given by $RR \over V_t$, with values >105 significant.
* Alertness
    * Conscious state adequate to protect airway
* Analgesia
