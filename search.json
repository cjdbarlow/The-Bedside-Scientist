If the tube is bitten, then deflate the pilot balloon to allow the patient to breath around the ETT, minimising the risk of negative-pressure pulmonary oedema.\nExtubate laterally\nLeft lateral with the head below the level of the heart if high aspiration risk. Especially useful in children as this helps to maintain airway without requiring jaw thrust.\n\n\n\nHigh-Risk Considerations\n\nPlace an airway exchange catheter or exchange wire\nIndicated when reintubation may be potentially anatomically difficult.\n\nCatheter is placed through ETT and left in place after extubation, and can be used as a stylet to guide reintubation\nAirway exchange wires are generally better tolerated, and can be left up to 72 hours\nWires require an exchange catheter to be railroaded prior to an ETT.\n\n\n\n\nAttenuating Physiological Response\nIf it is important to minimise coughing or maintain tight haemodynamics peri-extubation, then consider:\n\nDeep extubation\nExtubation after recovery of spontaneous ventilation but prior to recovery of laryngeal reflexes. Haemodynamically stable but risks both aspiration and airway obstruction; so is contraindicated in patients who are at risk of aspiration, difficult mask ventilation, or difficult reintubation. Process:\n\nEnsure steady, stable, adequate ventilation on minimal pressure support\nNo response (cough, breath-hold, or altered respiratory pattern) to:\n\nRemoval of ETT tape/tie\nSuctioning of oropharynx\nDeflation of ETT cuff\n\nRemove ETT at end-inspiration\n\nLignocaine\n\n1-1.5mg/kg IV peri-extubation via cuff\nUse lignocaine in ETT cuff\nMust be delivered early (usually with induction) and given adequate time to work.\n\nLMA exchange (“Bailey maneuvre”)\nExchange ETT for an LMA during a deep plane of anaesthesia and allow emergence to occur with the LMA in situ.\nRemifentanil\nEffect site 2.0ng/mL peri-extubation.\n\n\n\nStrategies for Difficult Extubation"

The protective nature of the larygneal closure reflex is exaggerated and prolonged in laryngospasm.\nMechanics of laryngospasm can be divided into:\n\nInspiratory stridor\nOccurs passively due to reduced aductor muscle tone.\nExpiratory stridor\nDue to active adduction of the cords.\nBall-Valve obstruction\nDue to closure of the true cords, the false cords, and the supraglottic tissues.\n\nIn this mechanism, positive pressure may worsen obstruction as distension of the pyriform fossae press the aryepiglottic folds more firmly against each other\nJaw thrust is more effective in correcting obstruction via this mechanism (though paralysis is still often required)"

Characterised by an inability to consistently abstain, impaired behavioural control, craving, and impaired recognition of problems with behaviours and interpersonal relationships.\n\n\nRisk Factors\nGeneral:\n\nFamily history of drug abuse\nChildhood abuse\nFamily dysfunction\nMental health disorder\nMale\nExperimenting with drugs/alcohol\nPeers who use drugs\nSense of professional immunity from addiction\n\nSpecific:\n\nDirect contact with drugs\nImmediate availability\nEasy to divert\n\n\n\nClinical Manifestations\n\nDisease process usually well-advanced by the time physical

Rapid onset is associated with increased uterine tone and foetal bradycardia.\n\n\nA Good Loading Technique\n\n5ml 0.2% ropivacaine\n\nIf intrathecal, should be associated with warm sensation (as with spinal) and rapid analgesia\nAsk the patient if they have a substantial reduction in pain.\nUsing a higher dose (e.g. 10ml) may also lead to early motor block, excessive sensory block, or hypotension\n\n100μg fentanyl\n\nIf intravascular, should be associated with a potent opioid effect (analgesia, narcosis)\n\nFurther 10-15ml 0.2% ropivacaine\nTitrated to achieve desired block height.\n\n\n\nNot-so-good Loading Techniques\n\n2% lignocaine\nAssociated with more motor block.\nAdrenaline\nHeart rate changes with 15-20μg of intravascular adrenaline are not reliably distinguishable from effect of epidural adrenaline, or normal heart rate variability.\nIdentify intravascular injection\nOptions include:\n\nNegative aspiration of blood prior to injection\nAdrenaline 15μg\nNeither sensitive nor specific, as it is associated with an increase in HR by ~30bpm for ~30s if intravascular, and ~20-30bpm if epidural. No respone may be seen in β-blocked patients.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintenance Dosing\n\n\nComplications\nThis covers complications unique to the labour epidural. Management of issues of insertion and troubleshooting an inadequate or failing epidural are covered elsewhere.\n\nFoetal Distress\nFoetal distress after an epidural is common, and may be:\n\nDirect\nRelated to effects of epidural drugs on the foetus, as some will be absorbed by the mother and transferred to the foetus. Effects seen depend on the type of drug, but are not clinically significant:\n\nOpioid\nRespiratory depression.\nLA\n\nTransient reduced variability\n\n\nIndirect\nRelated to effects on the mother by epidural. Include:\n\nMaternal ↓ BP\nMaternal symptholysis results in reduced uteroplacental perfusion, and foetal ischaemia. Requires correction of BP and intrauterine resuscitation.\nOxytocin/Adrenaline Imbalance\nTheory based on the fact that rapid onset of analgesia results in a rapid fall in the circulating (tocolytic) adrenaline, resulting in unopposed oxytocin stimulation and a subsequent fall in uteroplacental perfusion due to the high intrauterine pressure. Notably, foetal distress does not appear to be increased with a CSE, despite the more rapid onset of analgesia with this technique.\nMaternal Positioning\nPosition for epidural may result in foetus compressing cord and reducing perfusion."

Harm from dysoxia is a function of:\n\nDuration\nLimited with rapid correction.\nTissue type\nHigh oxygen demand and extraction organs have poor tolerance to tissue hypoxia.\n\nHypoxia sensitive:\n\nHeart\nBrain\n\nHypoxia less-sensitive:\n\nKidney\nSkin\n\n\n\nDysoxia can occur when DO2 is apparently adequate, and results from either:\n\nFailure of cells to utilise available oxygen\nSometimes referenced as histotoxic shock or cytopathic hypoxia.\nIntra-organ arteriolar shunting preventing oxygen delivery to the cell, despite adequate organ oxygen delivery\n\n\n\n\nAetiology\nCauses by mechanism include:\n\nHypovolaemic\n\nBlood loss\n\nTrauma\nPulmonary haemorrhage\nGIT\nObstetric\nRetroperitoneal\nIntra-abdominal\n\nFluid loss\n\nGIT losses\nSweating\nPolyuria\nPancreatitis\nBurns\n\n\nObstructive\n\nTamponade\nTension pneumothorax\nPE\nDynamic obstruction\n\nCardiogenic\n\nMyocardium\n\nIschaemia\n\nRupture\n\nMyocarditis\nContusion\n\nValvular\n\nThrombus\nChordae rupture\n\nArrhythmia\n\nBradyarrhythmia\nTachyarrhythmia\n\n\nDistributive\n\nSepsis\nSIRS/MODS\nAnaphylaxis\nNeurogenic\nAdrenal\nThyroid\nDrug toxicity"

    "text": "Management\n\nManagement of AF has traditionally been divided into two competing strategies:\n\nRate control\nRemain in AF, with controlled ventricular rate. Requires anticoagulation.\nRhythm control\nConversion to sinus rhythm. May be superior to rate control, if it can be achieved, and is desirable in patients:\n\n<60\nStructurally normal hearts\nReversible precipitant of AF\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rate/rhythm control debate is made more complex by the fact that rate control strategies result in SR in ~35% of patients, and rhythm control fails in 40-60% of patients. Rhythm control agents (amiodarone, flecainide) also have poorer side effect profiles than rate control agents.\n\nOverall, rhythm control is probably superior if it can be consistently achieved without requirement for heavy-duty antiarrhythmics; and so is most ideal in a young patient, without structural heart disease, and good cardiac reserve.\nResuscitation:\n\nRhythm control\n\nSpecific Therapy:\n\nPharmacological\n\nHaemodynamic control\nOne of:\n\nRhythm control\nRate control\n\nAnticoagulation\n\nProcedural\n\nAblation\nAchieves drug-free rhythm control in >80% after one attempt, and >90% after two attempts.\n\n\nSupportive Care:\n\nTreat precipitant\n\n\nRhythm Control\n\nUrgent electrical cardioversion is recommended for haemodynamically unstable AF with RVR - just as with other unstable tachyarrhythmias.\n\nElectrical cardioversion:\n\nElectrical cardioversion to restore SR\nSynchronised electrical cardioversion indicated if haemodynamically unstable. Requires sedation in the conscious patient.\nStroke risk Conversion to sinus rhythm is associated with a temporary ↑ stroke risk, as any clot formed in the static atria may embolise when atrial contraction resumes.

    "text": "Technique\nA PAC is inserted through a sheath:\n\nSheaths are usually placed in the right IJV or left SCV as these form a natural angle for the curved PAC to enter the RA\n\nOnce the sheath is in situ, open the PAC:\n\nRemove the catheter tip from its cover\nCheck integrity of the PAC balloon by inflating it\nFeed the PAC cover over the cathether and secure it in place\nCap off any unused lumens\nPass the PAC hub to the assistant\n\nHave the assistant prime each catheter lumen and zero each transducer\nConfirm that each lumen is being transduced correctly by rotating the catheter tip\nIf the CVP lumen remains at the same elevation but the catheter tip is raised, the measured PAP should fall but the CVP should remain the same.\nConfirm that the zero on each line is correct\nBoth should measure the same pressure at the same elevation.\n\nFloat the PAC:\n\nInsert PAC to 20cm\nHave assistant inflate balloon\nEnsure closed-loop communication whilst floating. Never withdraw the catheter with the balloon inflated.\nSmoothly insert the catheter at a rate of ~3cm/second whilst watching the PA waveform\nFor an IJ approach, the RV should be reached at ~30cm mark, PA should be reached at ~40cm mark, and a wedge (if desired) achieved at the 50cm mark.\n\nIf the correct waveforms are not being seen, then deflate the balloon, withdraw and reattempt\n\nOnce a PA waveform is seen, advance 1cm further and then deflate the balloon\n\nThis is to ensure that the catheter does not end up in the RVOT, where it will cause arrythmias\nNote that the catheter will expand as it warms, and can spontaneously wedge if it is inserted too far\n\nEnsure the catheter is left with the balloon deflated, the syringe empty, and the tap open to prevent accidental balloon inflation"
