# Tracheostomy Insertion

Place at 2-3 ring to minimise fistula risk.

The outer tube should not be changed for at least **1 week** to allow the tract to mature. If it does, someone skilled in airway management and prepared to intubate should be present.

## Technique

### Top End

* Insert bronchoscope to carina
* Withdraw ETT into mouth whilst ensuring bronchoscope remains in trachea
* Over-inflate ETT cuff in the oropharynx
* Advance ETT over bronchoscope so it is abutting the vocal cords, and secure with gentle forwards pressure
