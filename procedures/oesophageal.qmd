# Oesophageal Balloon

:::info
Oesophageal balloons include the Linton-Nachlas (Linton) tube, Sengstaken-Blakemore (Blakemore) tube, and Minnesota tube, which differ in the number and size of the balloon(s).
:::

Oesophageal balloon tamponade is used for **temporisation** of massive variceal haemorrhage until definitive treatment (generally endoscopy, occasionally TIPS) can be performed.

:::

## Indications

* Massive variceal haemorrhage\
Use has substantially ↓ with improved access to endoscopy. Provides control of up to:
	* 92% of oesophageal haemorrhage
	* 88% of gastric haemorrhage


## Contraindications

* Non-secure airway
* Controlled variceal haemorrhage
* Oesophageal rupture\
Boerhaave syndrome.
* Oesophageal stricture
* Unclear source of bleeding

:::column-margin
:::caution
Oesophageal tamponade should only be performed on an intubated patient.
:::
:::

## Anatomy

* The oesophagus is usually ~25cm long
* Varices occur secondary to portal hypertension, and may form in the:
	* Distal third of the oesophagus
	* Gastro-oesophageal junction
	* Gastric fundus
	* Gastric antrum


## Equipment

* PPE\
High volume haematemesis.
* Laryngoscope
* Oesophageal balloon
* Lubricant
* 50mL syringe
* Stopcocks
* Luer-lock caps
* Pressure manometer\
As used for ETT cuff inflation.
* Portable XR
* 500mL-1L saline\
Or similar, for traction.
* Crepe bandage

## Technique

:::crisis
**Inflation** of the **gastric balloon in** the **oesophagus is** usually **fatal**. Ensure the device is seated correctly in the stomach before inflating the oesophageal balloon.
:::

Preparation:

* Sit the patient at 45°\
↓ Aspiration risk.
* Check each balloon for leaks by underwater inflation
* Thoroughly lubricate each balloon

:::column-margin
Tubes can be placed nasally, and historically this seems common. However, in general oral placement is preferred as the patient is:

* Intubated\
Or should be, given the high risk of aspiration.
* Coagulopathic
* Thrombocytopaenic
:::

Insertion:

* Insert the tube via the mouth under laryngoscopic guidance to **50cm**
* Inflate the gastric balloon with 50-100mL of air
* **Confirm position of the gastric balloon** under the diaphragm with **CXR**
* Fully inflate gastric balloon\
See the above table for the total volume. Use a stopcock to prevent gas leaking out whilst insufflating the tube.
* Gently retract balloon back against the gastric fundus until resistance is felt\
Usually at 30-35cm.
* Tie crepe bandage to balloon and to bag of saline, and then perform traction using the bed pole.
* Secure the balloon in location\
Consider using an additional connector on the endotracheal tube fastener.
* Attach medium suction to gastric port\
60-100mmHg suction.
* Attach high suction to oesophageal port\
120-150mmHg.

:::


Oesophageal Tamponade:

* Gastric fundal tamponade is usually adequate; oesophageal inflation should only be used if there is continual bleeding despite an adequately inflated and tensioned gastric balloon
* Inflate oesophageal balloon to **25-30mmHg**
* Deflate balloon by 10mmHg Q2H once bleeding has resolved


Removal:

:::column-margin
Local protocols may vary, this describes one method for staged removal.
:::

* Fully deflate the oesophageal balloon
* Monitor for 4-6 hours
* Release tension on the gastric balloon
* Monitor for further 4-6 hours
* Deflate the gastric balloon
* Monitor for further 4-6 hours
	* Gastric aspirates for blood volume
	* Haemodynamic stability
* Remove the tube


## Complications

:::caution
This is a morbid procedure; **overall complication rate is ~20%**.
:::

:::column-margin
![Minnesota - Malpositioned](/resources/minnesota_mal.jpg)
:::

* A
	* Aspiration
* C
	* Cardiac compression
* D
	* Pain
* G
	* Oesophageal perforation
	* Pressure necrosis
		* Deflate after 12 hours
		* Do not use longer than 24-36 hours
