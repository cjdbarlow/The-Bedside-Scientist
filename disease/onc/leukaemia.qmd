# Leukaemia

Haematological malignancy causing uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal haematopoietic progenitor cells, which:

* Replaces normal bone marrow with dysfunctional leukocytes\
Leads to bone marrow failure, characterised by:
	* ↓ Haematopoiesis
	* Immunocompromise
* Classified based on the type of haematological progenitor cell affected:
	* **Acute Myeloid Leukaemia**\
	Uncontrolled proliferation of myeloid precursors. Rapidly progressive leukaemia which are further divided into:
		* AML with characteristic genetic abnormalities\
		Generally good prognosis. Includes:
			* Several known translocations
			* Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APML)\
			Associated with DIC.
		* AML with multi-lineage dysplasia
		Typically progresses from myelodysplasia and has poor prognosis.
		* Therapy-related AML\
		AML following chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
	* **Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia**\
	Uncontrolled proliferation of lymphoid precursors.
		* Usually seen in childhood
		* Good prognosis
		* CNS involvement is common
	* **Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia**\
	Slow-growing accumulation of mature but abnormal lymphocytes.
		* Common in elderly
		* 8-12 year median survival
		* May transform to diffuse large B cell lymphoma\
		Consequentially very poor prognosis.
	* **Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia**\
	Accumulation of mature but abnormal lymphocytes that:
		* Occurs in three phases, which occur as additional mutations accrue:
			* Chronic phase\
			May last several years, with minimal symptoms.
			* Accelerated phase\
			More rapid proliferation with ↑ symptoms.
			* Blast crisis\
			Proliferation of immature blasts, resembling acute leukaemia.
	* Ambiguous lineage\
	Evidence of either both lymphoid and myeloid cells, or where there are not enough categories to accurately classify it.

## Assessment

**History**:

**Exam**:

### Investigations

**Bedside**:

**Laboratory**:

### Diagnostic Approach and DDx

Diagnosis confirmed with:

* Blast cells
* Immunophenotyping
* Cytogenetic analysis
* Molecular genetic analysis

## Management

:::priority
* Chemotherapy
:::

**Resuscitation**:

**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
	* Chemotherapy
		* Consists of three phases:
			* Induction chemotherapy\
			Achieve remission by ↓ cells to undetectable levels.
			* Consolidation chemotherapy\
			Eliminate residual undetectable disease.
			* Maintenance therapy\
			Prolong remission. Used in ALL and APML.
		* Intrathecal chemotherapy used if CNS is involved
	* Total body radiotherapy
* Procedural
	* Radiotherapy
* Physical

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:

**Preventative**:
