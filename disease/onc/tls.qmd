# Tumour Lysis Syndrome

Life-threatening metabolic syndrome that occurs due to **rapid destruction** of a **large number** of **tumour cells** leading to toxic changes in ECF composition, namely:

* **Hyperuricaemia**
	* Nephropathy\
	Due to uric acid deposition in the DCT.
* **Hyperkalaemia**
* **Hyperphosphataemia**
* **Hypocalcaemia**\
Due to phosphate precipitation.



## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

TLS occurs most commonly:

* In high-volume malignancies:
	* Bulky solid tumours
	* Haematological malignancies
* Following a treatment
	* Chemotherapy
	* Radiotherapy


## Clinical Manifestations

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

## Management

**Resuscitation**:\

* C
	* Arrhythmia\
	Secondary to hyperkalaemia. Standard treatment applies.

**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
	* Preventative
		* Intravenous hydration
		* Uric acid suppression
			* Rasburicase\
			Rapidly ↓ uric acid by catalysing it to allantoin.
			* Allopurinol\
			↓ Uric acid formation by inhibiting xanthine oxidase. Less preferred to rasburicase as xanthine is accumulated, which can itself cause renal failure.
* Procedural
	* RRT\
	May be required for hyperkalaemia or hyperphosphataemia.

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:
