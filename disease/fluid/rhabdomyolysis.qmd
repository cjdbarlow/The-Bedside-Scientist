# Rhabdomyolysis

Clinical syndrome characterised by widespread destruction of skeletal muscle leading to massive release of intracellular contents into the bloodstream, leading to:

:::column-margin
**Crush syndrome** is a related entity which occurs when a crush injury leads to rhabdomyolysis but also prevents venous return from the affected limb, limiting systemic sequelae.\
\
Relief of the crushing force (generally during extraction) results in reperfusion and ischaemic washout, which may precipitate profound haemodynamic instability or hyperkalaemic arrest.

* HAGMA
* ↑ K^+^
* ↑ PO~4~\
Causing a subsequently ↓ Ca^2+^.
* Hyperuricaemia
* ↑ Mg^2+^\
Suggests significant concomitant AKI, due to ability of a functioning kidney to rapidly normalise magnesium levels.

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

At-risk groups include:

* Males
* Morbidly obese
* Statin users
* Post-operative

## Pathophysiology

Common pathway of muscle destruction:

* Loss of cellular ATP ↓ efficacy of membrane pumps, resulting in intracellular Na^+^
* Secondary ↑ in Ca^2+^ occurs as 2Na^+^/Ca^2+^ pumps activate to correct ↑ Na^+^
* ↑ Intracellular Ca^2+^ activates various proteases, which destroy cellular and mitochondrial membranes
* Muscle cells necrose, releasing cytotoxic intracellular machinery
	* Myoglobin may precipitate, causing renal tubular obstruction\
	This occurs due to interaction with the Tamm-Horsfall protein, and is accelerated in acidic conditions.
	* Hydroxyl radicals lead to lipid peroxidation and tubular sloughing
	* Metabolic acidosis promotes myoglobin cast formation in the DCT

### Aetiology

* Neuromuscular
	* Seizures
* Fluid and electrolyte
	* DKA
	* Hypokalaemia
	* Hypophosphataemia
	* Hypocalcaemia
* Traumatic
	* Crush injury
	* Compartment syndromes
	* Burns
	* Prolonged lie
* Infective
	* NSTI
	* Influenza
	* EBV
	* Primary HIV
	* Legionella
* Environmental
	* Heat injury
	* Exercise
* Toxic
	* Statins
	* MH
	* Serotonin syndrome
	* Propofol infusion syndrome
	* Alcohol
		* Delirium tremens
* Congenital
	* Various mitochondrial disorders
	* Lipid metabolic disorders
* Idiopathic


## Clinical Features

* Muscle pain
* Weakness
* Dark-tea coloured urine\
Requires 100mg/dL of myoglobin, therefore not all cases of rhabdomyolysis develop frank myoglobinuria.
* Oligo-anuria
* Intravascular volume depletion\
Due to tissue oedema.

## Assessment



### History

### Exam

### Investigations

**Bedside**:

**Laboratory**:

* Blood
	* ↑ K^+^
	* ↑ PO~4~
	* ↓ Ca^2+^
	* ↑ AST
	* ↑ LDh
	* CK\
	Generally 5-10× ULN (~1000-2000) U/L is diagnostic, through values can rise much higher.
		* Rise during first 12 hours
		* Peak at 3-5 days
		* Return to baseline over following 6-10 days
	* Myoglobin\
	Pathognomonic, but rarely measured.
	* ↓ Urea:Creatinine ratio\
	Due to ↑↑ creatinine, secondary to muscular destruction.
* Urine
	* Myoglobin
	* Dipstick\
	Also interactions with myoglobin - myoglobinuria can be inferred with a positive (for blood) dipstick with no red cells in the sediment.

### Diagnostic Approach and DDx


## Management

:::priority
* Early, aggressive **volume resuscitation**
	* **Limit** degree of **AKI**
* Target **urine** output **>300ml/hr**
* Consider RRT
* Avoid correcting calcium
:::

**Resuscitation**:

* C
	* **Volume** resuscitation\
	Often in the order of litres per day, targeting a **urine** output of **>300mL/hr** in adults.
* F
	* Correct **electrolytes**
		* Rapid correction of hyperkalaemia
		* Avoid correction of calcium to ↓ risk of calcium-phosphate precipitation

**Specific therapy**:

:::column-margin
Urinary alkalinisation is covered under @sec-urine_alk.
:::

* Pharmacological
	* **Mannitol**\
	Consider if volume resuscitation does not lead to adequate UO. Avoid in anuric patients.
	* **Sodium Bicarbonate**\
	Reasonable to correct systemic acidosis. Urinary alkalinisation:
		* Is sometimes recommended
		* *May* ↓ myoglobin toxicity by limiting myoglobin cast formation
		* Can be abandoned if urinary pH does not ↑ to >6.5
* Procedural
	* **RRT**\
	Effectively clears myoglobin.
* Physical



**Supportive care**:

* F
	* Avoid replacing calcium

**Disposition**:

**Preventative**:


### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

* **Loop diuretics**\
Can be considered if inadequate urine output is not achieved with volume resuscitation and mannitol.


## Anaesthetic Considerations

## Complications

* Death\
20-60% among ICU patients with rhabdomyolysis.
* F
	* AKI\
	10-60% of cases.
	* ↑ Ca^2+^\
	May complicate renal recovery, which occurs due to mobilisation of precipitated calcium and normalisation of PO~4~.
* I
	* Soft tissue CaPO~4~ deposition
