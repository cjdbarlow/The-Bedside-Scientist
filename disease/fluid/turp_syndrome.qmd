# TURP Syndrome

**Systemic absorption** of **glycine** which causes **cardiac** and **neurological toxicity** due to:

* Rapid changes in:
	* Osmolality\
	With associated hyponatraemia.
	* Circulating volume
* Direct CNS effects


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Prevalence:

* Confusion, nausea, vomiting in ~2% of TURP patients


Primary risk factor is rate and amount of irrigation fluid absorption:

* Volume absorbed is directly proportional to degree of hyponatraemia\
**~10mmol/L** fall **for each 1L of irrigation fluid absorbed**; though this will vary depending on lean body weight.
* Factors influencing rate of absoprtion:
	* Operating time\
	⩾1 hour.
	* Low venous pressure\
	CVP ⩽10 will permit fluid absorption.
		* Hypovolaemia
		* Hypotension\
	* Extensive bleeding
	* Capsular perforation
	* High irrigation fluid pressure


## Pathophysiology

Due to systemic absorption of hypertonic irrigation fluid:

* Fluids used include:
	* Glycine 1.5%\
	220mOsmol/kg.
	* Sorbitol 3%
	* Mannitol 5%
* Used as a nonconductive irrigation fluid in percutaneous procedures using **unipolar** diathermy
	* Use is rarer now that bipolar diathermy more common\
	Though large fluid shifts still occur due to absorption irrigation fluid.
	* Procedures include
		* TURP
		* Hysteroscopy

Effects due to::

* Osmolality\
Effects mostly due to hypoosmolality, rather than hyponatraemia.
* Circulating volume
* Direct neurological effects of glycine\
Acts as major inhibitory neurotransmitter and potentiates NMDA in CNS.
	* Less common with sorbitol
	* Significantly less common with mannitol


## Clinical Manifestations

Timing:

* Intraoperatively\
Within 15 minutes.
* Post-operatively\
Up to 24 hours.

Presentation:

* Early:
	* Headache
	* Restlessnes
	* Dyspnoea
	* Burning sensation in face and hands
	* Visual disturbance\
	Mainly due to glycine.
* Late/severe:
	* Hypoxia
	* Pulmonary oedema
	* Nausea/vomiting
	* Confusion/convulsions/coma


## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

## Management

### Prevention

* Avoid use of non-electrolyte fluids\
Use bipolar diathermy.
* Minimise fluid absorption
* Monitor fluid absorption\
Calculate deficit between administered and suctioned fluid.
* Have a (predetermined) threshold at which to abandon surgery
	* At 750ml-1L:\
	Depending on weight and sex.
		* Cease fluid administartion
		* Assess mental state
		* Check serum sodium
	* At 1-2L:\
	Depending on weight and sex.
		* Abandon surgery
		* Assess mental state
		* Check serum sodium


### Therapeutic

* **Abandon surgery**.

Correct:

* Volume changes
	* Cease IV fluid
	* Frusemide\
	Only recommended if APO is present, as it will worsen hyponatraemia.
* Solute changes
	* 3% NaCl\
		* 100ml, Q10 minutely, until resolution or 300ml given\
		Each bolus should raise serum sodium by ~2-3mmol/L.
		* Indicated if:
			* Serum sodium is ⩽120mmol/L
			* Serum osmolality is <260mOsm/kg
			* Severe neurological symptoms
				* Transient blindness
				* Persistent nausea/vomiting
				* Severe headaches
				* Severe hypotension


Supportive therapy:

* Bradycardia\
	* Atropine
	* Adrenaline
* Seizures\
	* Benzodiazepines
	* Magnesium\
	May be considered if refractory.


### Anaesthetic Considerations

* C
	* Arterial line\
	Recommended if managing as TURP syndrome.
	* Consider CVC


## Complications

* SIADH occurs in most patients, and impairs correction of hyponatraemia


## Prognosis

Associated with significant harm:

* Morbidity ~20%
* Mortality ~1%
