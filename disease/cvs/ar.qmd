Aortic regurgitation 


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

Regurgitation may occur due to disease of the:

* Valve
	* Rheumatic
	* Degenerative
	* Bicuspid
* Root\
Resulting in annular dilation.
	* Marfans
	* Degenerative
	* Syphilitic
	* Dissection

## Assessment

Chronic regurgitation:

* Usually has a long symptom free period
* Significant dilatation and impairment leads to:
	* Dyspnoea
	* Palpitations
	* Fatigue
	* Angina

Chronic regurgitation:

* Typically leads to acute fulminant heart failure
* Requires urgent intervention

### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

## Anaesthetic Considerations

:::column-margin
In mixed valvular disease, management should prioritise the most haemodynamically significant lesion. That said, in general:

:::

* C
	* Maintain preload
	* Cautious use of venodilators
	* High-normal heart rate to maintain forward flow
	* Maintain inotropy
	* Minimise afterload\
	â†“ Regurgitant fraction.
	* IABP is contraindicated
	* May be more difficult to wean from CPB
		* Myocardial protection is more difficult to establish
		* Coronary air embolism more likely


## Complications

## Prognosis

* Death\
5-10 year median life expectancy after symptom development.
