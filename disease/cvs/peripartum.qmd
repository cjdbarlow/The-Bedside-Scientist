# Peripartum Cardiomyopathy

*This covers peripartum cardiomyopathy. Management of [cardiac disease in pregnancy](/disease/obs/cardiac.md) is covered elsewhere.*

Development of cardiac failure:

* Between the **last month** of **pregnancy** and **five months postpartum**
* In absence of:
	* Identifiable cause, or
	* Cardiac disease prior to the last month of pregnancy
* As defined by LV dysfunction on echo  
With:
	* LVEF <45%, or
	* Fractional shortening <30%
	* +/- LVEDD >2.7cm/m^2^

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Incidence:

* ~1:5,000-10,000

Risk Factors:

* Multiple Pregnancy
* Multiparity
* â†‘ maternal age
* Hypertension
* Black race
* Drug use:
	* Sympathomimetics
	* Tocolytics
	* Cocaine

## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

## Clinical Manifestations

Features:

* Similarly to other cardiac failures
* Wheeze may be misdiagnosed as asthma

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

* Echocardiography
	* 

## Management

### Anaesthetic Considerations

### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

## Complications

## Prognosis

Recovery:

* 30-50% will recover normal LV function
	* Better recovery if LVEF is >30% at diagnosis
	* Dobutamine stress test correlates with liklihood of recovery

Subsequent pregnancy:

* Associated with significant morbidity  
Generally better than the pregnancy with the cardiomyopathy however:
	* 25% develop cardiac failure
	* 15% have a fall in EF  
	10% have a persistent reduction in EF.
	* 13% premature birth rate
