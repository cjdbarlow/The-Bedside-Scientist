# Acute Coronary Syndromes

Acute coronary syndrome defines the spectrum of myocardial ischaemia, that is subdivided into:

:::column-margin
The term OMI (occlusive myocardial infarction) has been suggested as an alternative to STEMI. This change in nomenclature is proposed so all patients who would **benefit from PCI** are overtly included in the classification, as patients with a STEMI-equivalent (i.e., would benefit from PCI, but who don't have STE) may go unrecognised.\
\
The language here will retain the traditional nomenclature, but it is good to keep in mind.
:::


* **Unstable Angina**\
Requires:
	* Ischaemic symptoms
	* No ECG changes
	* No biomarker elevation
* **Myocardial Infarction**\
Further subclassified by:
	* ECG changes, indicating appropriate therapeutic pathway:
		* **STEMI** and STEMI-equivalents\
		Strong benefit from a rapid reperfusion therapy. Requires all of:
			* Ischaemic symptoms
			* Qualifying ECG changes
				* New LBBB\
				False positive in ~40%.
			* Dynamic change in biomarkers\
			Will inevitably ↑, although intervention ideally takes place prior to this occurring and so is not necessary for diagnosis.
		* **NSTEMI**\
		Requires two of:
			* Ischaemic symptoms
			* Ischaemic ECG changes
			* Dynamic ↑ in biomarkers
	* Cause:
		* **Type 1**\
		Secondary to coronary event.
		* **Type 2**\
		Ischaemic imbalance; i.e. mismatch in myocardial oxygen supply and demand.Causes include:
			* Tachyarrhythmias
			* Sepsis
			* Coronary spasm
			* Anaemia
			* Hypo/hypertension

:::column-margin
There are three additional subtypes of MI, with minimal clinical implication:

* Type 3\
Death with symptoms and ECG changes, but no biomarkers available.
* Type 4
	* 4a: Secondary to PCI
	* 4b: Secondary to stent thrombosis
* Type 5\
Secondary to CABG.

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

ACS are a major cause of mortality in the industrialised world:

:::column-margin
Note that the definition of MI and therefore the *actual disease treated* has evolved over time. Historically, the diagnostic features were Q-waves, indicating myocardium with a completed infarct. In the reperfusion era, it was noted that patients with STE were the ones who benefited from thrombolysis or PCI - STEMI as an entity exists to delineate these two groups.\
\
In more recent years with the introduction of high-sensitivity troponin, more patients with UA are now been classified with a NSTEMI.
:::

* ~15% of all deaths
	* 70% of these are OOHCA
	* 60% of deaths are within first hour\
	Usually prior to reaching medical facility.
	* ↑ To 20% of deaths in persons >40
* ↓ In in-hospital mortality from 30% to <10% with current therapy\
However, significant issues remain in receiving appropriate medical therapy.
	* ~25% of eligible patients don't receive reperfusion\
	↑ In women and the elderly. 

Risk factors:

* Age
* Male
* Family history
* Smoking
* Disease
	* HTN
	* DM
	* Dyslipidaemia
	* Obesity


## Pathophysiology

Mechanisms include:

* Plaque rupture
	* Atheromatous plaque develops over vessel wall injury
		* Lipid accumulates in arterial intima
		* Fibrous cap develops\
		Usually occurs slowly, may happen more quickly in those with risk factors.
	* Plaque rupture\
	Plaque breaks, exposing thrombogenic lipids.
	* Platelet activation forms a plug over the plaque, occluded blood flow
* Coronary spasm

Which vessel and how proximal the occlusion is determines the region and extent of myocardial ischaemia:

* LAD occlusion
	* Anterior MI\
	~40-50%.
	* Septal MI
* LCx\\Distal LAD
	* Lateral MI
* RCA\\PLB of LCx\\Dominant LCx\
	* Inferior\
	~50%.
	* Posterior\
	~3%. Usually associated with inferior or lateral MI.
	* RV MI\
	Usually occurs with inferior MI. Concerns are ↓↓ HR, ↓ BP with GTN.


## Clinical Manifestations

:::info
ACS features are more specific for a Type 1 rather than Type 2 MI, which are often free of ischaemic symptoms.\
\
Clinical context is used to differentiate the two.
:::

"Classical" presentation:

:::column-margin
Pain of unstable angina is usually similar but milder.
:::

* Pain
	* Severe
	* Constant
	* Retrosternal
	* Radiation to throat, jaw, ulna aspect of each arm, interscapula
	* No clear precipitant
	* Worse on exertion or emotion
* Associated autonomic symptoms
	* Sweating
	* Nausea
	* Dyspnoea
	* Anxiety

"Atypical" symptoms:

:::column-margin
Atypical presentations occur in 25-45% of patients, and is more likely in patients who are:

* Female
* Elderly
* Diabetic
* Obese
* Have heart failure
:::

* Pain
	* Epigastric
	* Localised to jaw, arms, wrists, or interscapular
	* Burning


## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

Differentials:

* B
	* PE
* C
	* Pericarditis
	* Aortic dissection

## Investigations

Bloods:

* Cardiac enzymes
	* Troponins\
	Highly specific for myocardial injury, but do not identify cause.
		* Rise over 4-6 hours
		* Peak 16-24 hours
		* Resolve over 7-14 days\
		Prolonged in renal failure.
	* CK

ECG:

* For diagnosis and infarct localisation
* Serial recordings\
	* Change in symptoms
	* Drawing troponin
	* Periodically

:::column-margin
ECG mimics of MI include:

* B
	* PE
* C
	* LVH
	* Old inferior MI
	* Benign Early Repolarisation
	* Digoxin therapy
* F
	* Hyperkalaemia
:::

Echo:

* LV function
* RWMA\
Infarct location. Presence of RWMA is sensitive but not specific for STEMI.
* Assess other differential diagnoses
* Infarct complications
	* Papillary muscle rupture
	* MR
	* Myocardial rupture
	* VSD

### ECG Indications for Reperfusion

STEMI and STEMI equivalents include:

1. ST Segment elevation
	* Men <40\
	2.5mm in V~2-3~ and 1mm in other leads.
	* Men >40\
	2mm in V~2-3~ and 1mm in other leads.
	* Women\
	1.5mm in V~2-3~ and 1mm in other leads
2. LBBB and one of:
	* Cardiogenic shock
	* Sgarbossa Criteria positive
		* *Concordant* STE >1mm in >1 lead\
		In a LBBB, there is normally discordant STE, i.e. the ST segment moves in the opposite direction to the QRS.
		* Concordant STD >1mm in >1 of V~1-3~
	* Smith-modified Sgarbossa criteria positive
		* Excessively discordant STE in >1 lead\
		Excessive discordance defined as ST elevation >25% of the preceding S-wave.
3. New RBBB and LAFB\
Strongly associated with proximal LAD occlusion.
4. Posterior MI\
STD >1mm in V~1-4~, +/- STE >0.5mm in V~8-9~.
5. Lateral wall MI\
Any STE in aVL with STD in III (II/aVF).


## Management

**Resuscitation**:\

* B:
	* Supplemental **oxygen**\
	Target SpO~2~ of 93-97%. Avoid hyperoxia, concerns that this may ↑ infarct size.
* C
	* **Venous access**
	* **Defibrillator** available
	* Sublingual **GTN**\
		* Indications:
			* Ischaemic pain
			* Hypertension
			* Pulmonary oedema
		* Contraindications:
			* Hypotension
			* RV MI
			* Recent PDE inhibitor


**Specific therapy**:

:::column-margin
GTN does not improve outcome and relief of pain is **not diagnostic for ischaemia**, but may be useful for symptom relief.
:::

* **Reperfusion** therapy\
In STEMI and STEMI-equivalents.
	* Thrombolysis
	* PCI
* Pharmacological
	* **Aspirin**\
		* 300mg load, then 100mg/day lifelong
		* ↓ Mortality by ~2.5%, halves rate of stroke and reinfarction
		* Consider clopidogrel if aspirin contraindicated
	* Consider **DAPT**\
		* Recommended if:
			* Anticipating primary PCI\
			Though benefit remains even if PCI not performed.
			* Low bleeding risk
			* Not bradycardic\
			Ticagrelor may worsen bradycardia.
		* May be:
			* Ticagrelor\
			180mg load, then 90mg BD.
			* Clopidogrel\
			May be preferred to ticagrelor for patients with ↑ bleeding risk. 300-600mg load, then 75mg daily.
		* Long half-lives result in ↑ bleeding if CABG is required
		* Duration depends on type of stenting
	* **Anticoagulation**\
	Stabilises clot and ↓ early infarction, but leads to rebound ↑ infarction
		* Fondaparinux 2.5mg daily\
		Preferred option, if available.
		* Enoxaparin 1mg/kg BD
		* Therapeutic heparin infusion
	* **β-blockers**\
		* **Only** in patients who are haemodynamically stable patients\
		Usually after thrombolytic therapy.
		* Ideally within 24 hours
		* ↓ Malignant arrhythmia rate
	* **ACE-I/A2RB**\
	↓ Mortality and ↓ LV failure in STEMI, probably beneficial in NSTEMI.
		* Contraindications
			* Renal dysfunction
			* Hypotension
			* Hyperkalaemia
	* **Statin**\
	Commence within 24 hours. ↓ Mortality.
		* Atorvastatin 80mg
	* Long-term anticoagulation\
	Only for specific indication, e.g. AF, LV thrombus, severe LV dysfunction.
* Physical
	* Lifestyle advice
	* Cardiac rehabilitation


**Supportive care**:

* C
	* Haemodynamic support
		* May be required prior to reperfusion for significant infarcts
		* Mechanical support
			* IABP\
			No good evidence of mortality benefit.
			* ECMO
* D
	* **Opioid** analgesia
* F
	* Electrolyte correction
		* K^+^ >4.5mmol/L
		* Mg^2+^ >1mmol/L
* H
	* Aim Hb > 80mg/L if ongoing ischaemia


**Disposition**:

* CCU
* ICU

### Reperfusion

:::danger
Thrombolysis should be performed for STEMI if PCI cannot occur in **<120 minutes**.
:::

Reperfusion ↓ infarct size and ↑ LV function, ↓ stroke rate, and ↓ mortality. Factors influencing reperfusion strategy:

* **Time**
	* Infarct
	* Transfer time
* **Contraindications to thrombolysis**
	* Absolute
		* Intracranial
			* Stroke <6 months
			* Intracranial neoplasm
		* Cardiac
			* Aortic dissection
		* Active internal bleeding
	* Relative
		* Bleeding risk
			* Coagulopathy
			* Hypertension
			* Recent major trauma
			* Peptic ulcer disease
		* Pregnancy
* **High risk features**\
Indication for PCI.
	* Ventricular arrhythmias
	* Cardiogenic shock
	* Pain refractive for medical therapy


Thrombolysis:

* Effective if performed **<3 hours from onset**\
Works best with fresh clot, prior to fibrin formation.
* ~4% ↓ in absolute mortality


PCI is preferred, provided it can occur in a timely fashion. PCI:

* Should be performed urgently\
Sooner is better, <60 minutes is the goal. PCI has ~6% ↓ in mortality.
* May be:
	* Primary PCI
	* Rescue PCI\
	PCI performed after failed thrombolysis. 


### Right Ventricular Myocardial Infarction

Additional considerations for the RV MI:

* C
	* RV support
		* Maintain preload\
		Nitrates, morphine, diuretics, PEEP, hypoxaemia.
		* iNO
		* Vasoactives

### Ineffective Therapies

## Anaesthetic Considerations

Occasionally, anaesthetic support to the cath lab is requested for patients with:

* Cardiogenic shock
* Agitation

## Complications

* Death
	* Malignant arrhythmias\
	Leading cause of death, particularly prehospital.
		* Major risk in first 4 hours\
		4-20% have VF in this period.
* Cardiogenic shock
* Pulmonary oedema
* MR
	* Functional\
	Related to LV dilation and diastolic dysfunction.
	* Papillary muscle rupture
* Ventricular rupture
* VSD 
* Ischaemic cardiomyopathy and cardiac failure\
15-25% following STEMI.
* Pericarditis/Dressler's syndrome\
Usually develops 24-72 hours post MI.
* Stroke\
Embolism from LV thrombus.

## Prognosis

Infarct size is influenced by time to reperfusion, and determines degree of:

* LV systolic dysfunction
* Diastolic dysfunction

## Key Studies

Antiplatelet agents:

* [PLATO](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/35/31/2083/2293063)\
Ticagrelor had improved mortality and ischaemic events compared to clopidogrel in NSTE-ACS, with no ↑ in bleeding.
