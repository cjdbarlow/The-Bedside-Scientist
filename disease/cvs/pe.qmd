# Pulmonary Embolism

Blockage of a pulmonary artery or its branches due to embolised clot, leading to RV dysfunction and impaired gas exchange. Significance ranges from trivial to life-threatening depending on the size of the occlusion and the native cardiac and (to a lesser extent) respiratory function.

PE is classified by degree of haemodynamic impairment into:

* Massive\
PE with hypotension (**SBP <90mmHg**). Indication for clot destruction via thrombolysis or embolectomy. Anticoagulation should be commenced once thrombolysis completed.
* Submassive\
PE with evidence of RV dysfunction (ECG, echo). Clot destruction controversial - low-dose thrombolysis may be more appropriate; anticoagulation is indicated.
* Mild\
PE without haemodynamic instability or RV dysfunction. No indication for clot destruction, anticoagulation is indicated.

Subsegmental PEs are also sometimes described, which refer to distal emboli seen on CT. They usually are asymptomatic, have no clinical significance, and do not require intervention.

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Risk factors for clot formation are given by Vichows triad:

:::column-margin
Systemic prothrombotic effects (e.g. Factor V Leiden, OCP use, obesity) predominantly increase risk of DVT (and later embolism), pulmonary disease tends to increase risk of PE without increasing DVT risk.
:::

* Stasis  
Many thrombi occur around venous valves.
	* Advanced age  
	Risk increases after 40.
	* Immobilisation
	* Obesity
	* General anaesthesia  
	~30-50% greater risk compared to spinal/regional technique.
* Endothelial Damage
	* Central venous access
* Hypercoagulable state
	* Surgery  
	Incidence depends on type of surgery:
		* Thoracic: ~2%
		* Abdominal: ~1%
		* Hip arthroplasty: Up to 30%
		* Knee arthroplasty: Up to 7%
		* Trauma: 2-6%
		* Neurosurgery: Up to 4%
		* Spinal cord injury: 5-9%
	* Hereditary
		* AT III deficiency
		* Protein C or S deficiency
		* Factor V leiden
		* Prothrombin gene deficiency
	* Pregnancy  
	DVT risk is 5x as high post-partum compared with durign pregnancy, and PE risk is 15x as high.
	* Malignancy
	* Acute illness
		* Trauma
		* Sepsis
	* Inflammatory diseases
		* IBD
		* Autoimmune disease
	* Previous VTE
	* Drugs
		* OCP  
		2-5x increased relative risk.
		* Chemotherapeutics
		* Smoking
		* Antipsychotics


Risk factors for death from PE:

* Age > 70
* Congestive heart failure
* COAD
* ASA score
* Hypotension and tachypnoea on diagnosis

## Pathophysiology

Key processes are:

* Clot formation and embolisation\
PE predominantly arise from DVT in the lower limbs, pelvic veins, or IVC. DVT can then:
	* Propagate proximally  
	PE will occur in ~50% of patients with proximal DVT. Below knee DVT rarely causes clinicially significant PE.
	* Break off entirely  
	~20% of patients with PE have no identified DVT.
* Impaired pulmonary gas exchange:
	* Increased alveolar dead space  
	Non-perfused alveoli distal to clot.
	* Over-perfusion of non-clotted lung  
	May cause shunt via a variety of mechanisms:
		* Oedema
		* Pulmonary haemorrhage  
		Pulmonary infarction does not usually occur due to ongoing perfusion from bronchial circulation.
		* Loss of surfactant
		* Vasoactive peptide secretion
* Acute RV dysfunction
	* Increased PVR  
	Pulmonary arterial obstruction leads to increased PVR and elevated RV afterload. May be exacerbated by low mixed venous PO~2~ .
	* Increased Right-sided pressures  
	Increase in RAP may open a PFO and lead to intracardiac right-to-left shunting and risk of systemic embolism.
	

## Clinical Manifestations

Clinical features depend on:

* Clot location
* Clot burden
* Severity of disease relating to underlying CVS reserve

Features are few and generally non-specific, but may be:

* Due to pulmonary infarction
	* Haemoptysis
	* Pleuritic chest pain  
	* Pleural rub  

* Due to pulmonary hypertension
	* RV pressure overload
		* Increased RAP  
		May be seen as elevated JVP.
		* Increased PVR
		* Decreased CO
		* Increased SVR
	* Loud P~2~

* Due to obstructive shock:
	* Cardiac arrest
	* Shock Index > 1 is strongly associated with in hospital mortality
	* Tachycardia  
	May be isolated finding.
	Tachypnoea
	* Hypotension


## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

PE should always be considered in patients with:

* Sudden onset syncope
* Hypotension
* Extreme hypoxia
* EMD
* Cardiac arrest

Assessing a patient who *may* have PE should:

* Commence with careful evaluation of history, risk factors, and physical exam
* Use a validated clinical prediction score to stratify need for further investigations
	* Wells Score
	* Geneva score


Other differentials include:

* B
	* Pneumonia
	* PTHx
	* Rib fractures
* C
	* Acute coronary syndrome
	* Aortic dissection
	* APO
* Trauma
	* Fat embolism
* Obstetric
	* Amniotic fluid embolism


## Investigations 

Can be divided into:

* Diagnostic tests
* Non-diagnostic tests


### Diagnostic Tests

Radiology:

* CTPA
	* Quicker and more available than V/Q scanning, but requires contrast load
	* ~85% sensitive  
	Varies depending on machine and radiologist.
		* Increases to ~100% of PEs with haemodynamic instability
		* Commonly identifies subsegmental PE in asymptomatic patients\
		Clinical significance is unclear, but do not require anticoagulation.
* VQ scan
	* May not be appropriate if existing cardio-pulmonary disease
	* Sensitivity increased with modern SPECT devices  
	~1% now non-diagnostic.
	* More sensitive than CTPA for peripheral emboli


Echocardiography:

:::column-margin
The absence of RV dilation in a haemodynamically unstable patient means that PE is an unlikely diagnosis.
:::

* Presence of thrombus  
~26% of severe PE can be seen on TOE, as this provides better visualisation of the MPA and RPA.
* Other disease
* Quantify RV dysfunction\
Findings include:
	* RV/LV end-diastolic diameter ratio > 0.7
	* RV/LV area ratio > 0.66
	* RV end-diastolic diameter > 27mm
	* "McConnel Sign"  
	RV free wall hypokinesis with RV apex normo or hyperkinesis.
	* Septal shift
	* TR jet >270cm/sec
	* Pulmonary artery acceleration time <60ms with maximum TR pressure <60mmHg (60/60 sign)


### Non-Diagnostic Tests

Bloods:

* D-Dimer
	* ~97% sensitive  
	May be useful in ruling out PE in patients with low to moderate clinical suspicion. Reduces the need for radiological tests.
	* Non-specific  
	Does not support diagnosis or indicate severity. Often raised in the critically ill. 
* Troponin  
	* Elevated in <50% of patients
	* Associated with adverse outcomes  
	Death, inotropes.
* BNP/NT-pro-BNP	
* ABG  
Typically demonstrates:
	* Hypoxaemia  
	May be only abnormality in smaller PEs.
	* Respiratory alkalosis


Radiology:

* CXR
	* Useful in supporting or ruling-out other causes of hypoxaemia and hypotension
	* Required prior to V/Q scan
* Lower limb ultrasound\
Identify presence of DVT.

ECG:

* No abnormalities\
~30%.
* Isolated sinus tachycardia
* Atrial arrythmias  
Associated with higher mortality.
* Repolarisation abnormalities  
Present in ~50% of PE patients.
* RBBB and precordial TWI best correlate with severity
* RV strain/cor pulmonale  
Also non-specific, but suggest massive embolism rather than smaller emvoli.
	* S1Q3T3
	* P-pulmonale
	* Incomplete RBBB
	* RAD


Respiratory Function Tests:

* Physiological dead space:
	* Almost always increased in the case of PE  
	Formal measurement is:
		* 100% sensitive
		* 89% specific
	* Requires an intubated/ventilated patient
	* Not easy to perform in practice
	* Suggested by
		* Acute reduction in ETCO~2~
		* Delay in reaching alveolar plateau on ETCO~2~ waveform


## Management

Management options include:

* Clot destruction
	* In selected patients, where benefit outweighs risk
	* Via embolectomy or thrombolysis
* Therapeutic anticoagulation
* Haemodynamic support
	* RV support
	* ECMO
	

### Clot Destruction

Methods include:

* IV thrombolysis
	* Most common tool
	* Dramatic improvement in haemodynamic state in 90% of patients following administration
		* ~50% reduction in mortality in massive PE
	* Tempered by significant bleeding in 10% of patients with standard dosing
		* Therapy should be ceased and factor replacement commenced if significant bleeding occurs
* Catheter-directed thrombolysis	
* Embolectomy
	* Endovascular
	* Open (surgical)\
	Overtaken by endovascular techniques due to high (25-50%) perioperative mortality, but may be appropriate in massive PE and:
		* Contraindications to thrombolysis
		* Unavailability of interventional radiology
		* Intracardiac thrombus


### Anticoagulation

Therapeutic anticoagulation inhibits clot progression, allowing intrinsic fibrinolysis to decrease clot burden. Anticoagulation:

* Decreases Mortality and recurrence\
May be reasonable to commence prior to formal diagnosis if bleeding risk is low.
* Initial anticoagulation should be performed with heparin:
	* UFH\
	Preferred in:
		* Renal impairment
		* Following thrombolysis/embolectomy due to reversibility
	* LMWH
		* More predictable dose-response than UFH
		* Faster time to therapeutic anticoagulation
* Transition to oral anticoagulation when bleeding risk stabilised
	* Warfarin
	* DOAC	


### Ineffective Therapies

## Complications

* Death
	* 25-30% of patients with RV failure requiring inotropes
	* Up to 13% of perioperative PEs
* Recurrence
	* ~6% within 6 months  
	Despite therapeutic anticoagulation.
	* ~8% with 12 months
* Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension
* Postthrombotic syndrome
