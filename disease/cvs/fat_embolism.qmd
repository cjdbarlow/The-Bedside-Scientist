# Fat Embolism Syndrome


Fat embolism syndrome is a serious consequence of embolisation of fat globules:

* **24-72 hours** after injury to medullary bone  
Usually due to:
	* Major trauma  
	95% of cases.
	* Intraoperative medullary reaming
* Into the:
	* Lung parenchyma
	* Peripheral circulation


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Primary risk factor is number of fractures:

* Single long bone fracture  
1-3%.
* Bifemoral fractures  
Up to 33%.


## Pathophysiology

Two major mechanisms of injury:

* Mechanical  
Mechanical obstruction of capillary beds, which explains:
	* Right heart dysfunction
	* Paradoxical embolism
* Biochemical  
Degradation of fat into pathogenic free fatty acids, which explains:
	* Delayed presentation
	* ARDS
	* Cardiac dysfunction

### Aetiology

Majority are trauma related, and include:

* Marrow-containing bone fractures
	* Long bone
	* Pelvis
* Orthopaedic surgery
* Fat injury
	* Burns

Non-trauma related:

* Bone related
	* Bone marrow transplant
	* Bone tumour lyses
	* Osteonecrosis
* Fat related
	* Liposuction
	* Pancreatitis
* Other
	* DM
	* Steroid therapy
	* Fatty liver disease
	* Haemoglobinopathies
		* Sickle-cell

## Clinical Manifestations

Presentation usually:

* Occurs 12-72 hours after injury  
May occur up to 2 weeks.
* Classical triad of hypoxia, neurological findings, and rash
* Respiratory changes  
Due to pulmonary embolism.
	* Dyspnoea
	* Tachypnoea
	* Hypoxaemia
* CVS changes
	* Obstructive shock
	* Right heart dysfunction
* Neurological features  
Due to cerebral embolism. Heterogenous appearance:
	* Confusion
	* Drowsiness
	* Seizures
* Haematological
	* Anaemia
	* Thrombocytopaenia
	* **Petechiae**  
		* Red-brown rash
		* Occurring in ~33% of cases
		* In non-dependent regions
		* Due to:
			* Microvascular haemorrhage
			* Paradoxical embolism


## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

Differential diagnoses include:

* Other sources of embolism  
	* PE
	* AFE
	* Tumour embolism
	* Foreign body embolism
	* Air embolism
* Pulmonary oedema
	* Pneumonia
	* Heart failure
	* ARDS
* Vasculitis

## Investigations

None are diagnostic:

* Bloods
	* FBE
		* Anaemia
		* Thrombocytopaenia
	* UECs
		* Hypocalcaemia  
		Due to free fatty acid binding.
* CXR  
May reflect developing ARDS.
* CR chest  
Focal ground glass opacification.
* MRI Brain  

Notably, aspiration of fat from a wedged PAC is neither sensitive nor specific.

## Management

Preventative:

* Medullary venting hole drilled prior to reaming  
Reduced major embolic events on TOE.
* Early fixation of fractures


Therapeutic is entirely supportive:

* ABC approach
* Maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation
* Right heart support

### Ineffective Therapies

Include:

* Methylprednisolone prophylaxis
	* 1.5mg/kg IV Q8H for 7 doses
	* Hypothesised to reduce perivascular haemorrhage  
	* No RCT evidence supporting use
* Heparin  
Theorised to remove lipaemia by stimulating lipase activity.

## Complications

Include:

* Death  
5-15%, usually due to:
	* Respiratory failure
	* Obstructive shock
	* Brian death

## Prognosis

Most recover spontaneously.
