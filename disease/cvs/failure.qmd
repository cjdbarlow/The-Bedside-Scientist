# Cardiac Failure


Cardiac failure is a syndrome describing the impediment to ventricular filling or ejection due to structural or functional myocardial disease. Cardiac failure is usually classified by:

* Time-course
	* Acute
	* Chronic
* Ejection fraction
	* Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (> 50%)
	* Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (< 40%)
	* (An EF of 40-49% is typically called a mid-range EF)

Classifications include both functional scores (NYHA) or disease progression (ACC/AHA):



## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

* Prevalence of chronic heart failure is ~2%  
	* < 2% in < 60 year-olds
	* > 10% in > 75 year-olds 
* Lifetime risk of disease is ~20%
* Annual mortality is 6-7% in patients with stable heart failure
	* Increases to 25%/year in hospitalised patients

## Pathophysiology

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction:


### Aetiology

Precipitating causes:

* Cardiac
	* Arrhythmias
		* AF
	* Ischaemia
		* AMI
		* Angina
* Infective
	* Pneumonia
* Drug
	* Alcohol excess
* Iatrogenic
	* IV fluids

## Clinical Manifestations

* Dyspnoea  
Pulmonary congestion due to raised LAP.
	* Moderately sensitive but poorly specific
* Orthopnoea  
Increased VR and pulmonary congestion in supine position.
	* More specific than dyspnoea, but insensitive
* PND  
As orthopnoea, but with additional respiratory depression.
* Pulmonary oedema/Crepitations  
Classically bilateral, due to pulmonary congestion.
* Pleural effusion  
Fluid retention and elevated LAP/RAP.


* Palpitations  
Tachyarrythmias and reduced exercise tolerance.



* Hepatomegaly  
Increased RAP.
* Hepatojugular reflex  
Increased RAP.
* Ascites  
Fluid retention.
* Cachexia  
Intestinal congestion, chronic inflammatory pathway activation.
* Early satiety  
Fluid retention.
* Anorexia  
Fluid retention.

* Fatigue  
Reduced skeletal muscle perfusion.


Examination:

* Oedema  
Fluid retention and elevated filling pressures.
	* Insensitive  
	Many elderly patients have oedema due to immobility.
* Elevated JVP  
Increased RAP.
* Displaced apex beat  
LV dilatation.
* Crepitations  
Highly specific.



## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

CXR:

* Pulmonary oedema
* Cardiomegaly

## Management

### Ineffective Therapies


## Complications

Atrial Fibrillation:

* Present in ~30% of patients  
May be either a cause or consequence.


Malignant arrhythmias:

* Increased risk with:
	* Ischaemia
	* Electrolyte abnormalities  
	Hypo/hyperkalaemia, hypomagnesaemia.
* Psychotropic drugs
* Digoxin
* Antiarrhythmics

Thromboembolism:

## Prognosis

Death:

* High in symptomatic heart failure
	* 20-30% one-year mortality in mild cases
	* â©¾50% one-year mortality in severe heart failure
* Predictors of poor outcome include:
	* High NYHA class
	* Reduced LVEF
	* Raised PCWP
	* Third heart sound
	* Reduced CI
	* DM
	* Hypernatraemia
	* Elevated catecholamines
	* Low predicted peak oxygen consumption with maximal exercise
