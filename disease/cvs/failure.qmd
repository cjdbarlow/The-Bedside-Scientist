# Cardiac Failure


Broad range of syndromes describing the impediment to ventricular filling or ejection due to structural or functional myocardial disease. Cardiac failure is usually classified by time course into:

* Acute\
Subclassified by congestion and perfusion
* Chronic\
Significantly improved outcomes with medical therapy. Subclassified by EF into:
	* Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (> 50%)
	* Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (< 40%)
	* (An EF of 40-49% is typically called a mid-range EF)

Classifications include both functional scores (NYHA) or disease progression (ACC/AHA):



## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

* Prevalence of chronic heart failure is ~2%\
	* < 2% in < 60 year-olds
	* > 10% in > 75 year-olds 
* Lifetime risk of disease is ~20%
* Annual mortality is 6-7% in patients with stable heart failure
	* ↑ to 25%/year in hospitalised patients

## Pathophysiology

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction:


### Aetiology

Precipitating causes:

* Cardiac
	* Arrhythmias
		* AF
	* Ischaemia
		* AMI
		* Angina
	* Hypertensive emergency
	* Mechanical
		* Valvular
		* Tamponade
		* PE	
* Neurological
	* Neuromuscular disease
* Infective
	* Sepsis
	* Pneumonia
	* Myocarditis
* Toxins
	* Alcohol
	* Beta-blockade
	* Calcium antagonists
	* Cocaine
* Iatrogenic
	* IV fluids

## Clinical Manifestations

* Dyspnoea\
	* Pulmonary oedema/Crepitations\
	Pulmonary congestion due to raised LAP. Moderately sensitive but poorly specific.
	* Pleural effusion\
	Fluid retention and elevated LAP/RAP. Classically bilateral, due to pulmonary congestion.

* Orthopnoea\
↑ VR and pulmonary congestion in supine position.
	* More specific than dyspnoea, but insensitive
* PND\
As orthopnoea, but with additional respiratory depression.


* Palpitations\
Tachyarrythmias and reduced exercise tolerance.



* Hepatomegaly\
↑ RAP.
* Hepatojugular reflex\
↑ RAP.
* Ascites\
Fluid retention.
* Cachexia\
Intestinal congestion, chronic inflammatory pathway activation.
* Early satiety\
Fluid retention.
* Anorexia\
Fluid retention.

* Fatigue\
Reduced skeletal muscle perfusion.


Examination:

* Oedema\
Fluid retention and elevated filling pressures.
	* Insensitive\
	Many elderly patients have oedema due to immobility.
* Elevated JVP\
↑ RAP.
* Displaced apex beat\
LV dilatation.
* Crepitations\
Highly specific.



## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

Blood:

* Troponin
* BNP\
Released in response to ↑ ventricular wall tension.
	* <100pg/mL is 90% sensitive/70% specific for excluding failure
* BT-proBNP\
Prohormone of BNP. Similar results for cut off of 300.
* S~cv~O~2~\
VBG from IJ or SCV line; <70% suggests inadequate DO~2~.

Radiology:

* CXR
	* Pulmonary oedema
	* Cardiomegaly

## Management

The crux of heart failure management is acheiving balance between the competing goals of:

* Ensuring adqeuate organ perfusion
* Minimising myocardial work

Choice of therapy depends on where the patient is on this spectrum. If this balance cannot be achieved with medical therapy, then **mechanical support** may be required.

### Improving Organ Perfusion

* Afterload\
Reduce with systemic vasodilators.
	* IV
		* GTN
		* SNP
		* Milrinone
* Preload	
* Contractility
	* Cease negative inotropes
	* Inotropes
* Rate\
↑ to high normal (~90); CO may fall with ↑ tachycardia depending on the diastolic function.
* Rhythm\
Restore sinus rhythm.
		
### Reduce Myocardial Work

* Afterload\
Reduce with systemic vasodilators.
	* PO
		* ACE-I
* Contractility
	* Negative inotropes\
	Improvement in ventricular filling, coronary perfusionn, and myocardial oxygen demand.
* Preload	
* Rate
* Rhythm\
Restore sinus rhythm.


### Mechanical Support

* Respiratory
	* NIV\
	Positive airway pressures (CPAP, PEEP) reduces LV wall tension and afterload.
	* Mechanical ventilation\
	In addition to the effects of ↑ airway pressure, mechanical ventilation substantially reduces work of breathing and therefore VO~2~. These gains may be significant (up to 30%), but is not a long-term solution.
* Cardiac
	* IABP
	* VAD
		* Temporary
		* Permanent	
	* ECMO	


### Additional Physiological Goals

Correct:

* Hypoxia
* Acidaemia
* Electrolyte derangements
* Anaemia
* Thiamine deficiency




### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies


## Complications

Atrial Fibrillation:

* Present in ~30% of patients\
May be either a cause or consequence.


Malignant arrhythmias:

* ↑ risk with:
	* Ischaemia
	* Electrolyte abnormalities\
	Hypo/hyperkalaemia, hypomagnesaemia.
* Psychotropic drugs
* Digoxin
* Antiarrhythmics

Thromboembolism:

## Prognosis

Death:

* High in symptomatic heart failure
	* 20-30% one-year mortality in mild cases
	* ⩾50% one-year mortality in severe heart failure
* Predictors of poor outcome include:
	* High NYHA class
	* Reduced LVEF
	* Raised PCWP
	* Third heart sound
	* Reduced CI
	* DM
	* Hypernatraemia
	* Elevated catecholamines
	* Low predicted peak oxygen consumption with maximal exercise
