# Mitral Regurgitation


Mitral regurgitation is classified in two ways:

* Aetiology
	* Primary  
	Due to valvular pathology.
	* Secondary/Functional  
	Due to LV dysfunction interfering with normal valvular function.
* Temporality
	* Acute  
	Pathology evolving faster than LA compensation, resulting in elevated LAPs, PAPs, and pulmonary oedema (classically severe and of rapid onset).
	* Chronic  
	MR with LA compensation. Symptoms may only develop after many years when the LV fails.


MR classification is complex, and is based on echocardiographic findings:

|Measurement|Mild|Moderate|Severe|
|--|--|--|
|Regurgitant fraction|<30%|30-49%|>50%
|Regurgitant volume|<30ml/beat|30-60ml/beat|>60ml/beat|
|Effective Regurgitant Orifice Area|â©½0.2cm^2^|0.2-0.39cm^2^|>0.4cm^2^|

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

## Clinical Manifestations

### History

### Examination

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

Echocardiography:

* Allows grading of severity
* LV assessment is confounded  
EF appears higher than it is due to the regurgitation fraction.
	* LVEF of ~70% is equivalent to ~55% in absence of MR.

## Management

Medical management of **acute MR** involves:

* Reducing filling pressures
	* Diuretics
	* Nitrates
* Reducing afterload
	* Vasodilators
	* IABP

Medical management of **chronic MR** involves treating cardiac failure, and cardioversion if required.

Surgical management of MR involves either repair (most common) or replacement (rare). Indications for surgery:

* Primary, severe, acute MR  
E.g. ruptured papillary muscle.
* Symptomatic chronic MR
* Asymptomatic MR with CVS sequelae:
	* LVEF <60%
	* AF
	* Pulmonary HTN


### Anaesthetic Considerations

* C
	* Maintain preload  
	Promotes forward flow.
	* Aim high-normal heart rate (80-100)  
	Reduces diastolic regurgitant fine.
	* Afterload reduction  
	Reduces regurgitatn fraction.
	* Inotropes



### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies
