# Atrial Flutter

Atrial re-entrant arrhythmia where the electrical impulse circles within the atria. The:

* Atrial rate is usually ~300
* Ventricular rate is function of AV nodal conduction and occurs as a **ratio** of the atrial rate
	* Usually 2:1, i.e. ventricular rate ~150
	* 1:1 is rare and potentially lethal
	* Ratio is usually fixed, so the ventricular rate is usually abnormally constant\
	Note the ratio may vary (e.g. between 2:1 and 3:1).
* Pathway may be either:
	* Typical\
		* Counter-clockwise circuit between the tricuspid orifice, vena cavae orifice, and crista terminalis
		* 90% of cases
		* Sawtooth appearance best seen in V~1~, with a negative defelction in the inferior leads
	* Non-typical
		* Clockwise circuit
		* Usually associated with atrial disease\
		Scar, structures.

:::info
Drug therapy for flutter is notoriously unsuccessful and electrical cardioversion is often required.
:::

**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
	* Antiarrhythmics
		* Class IA and IC drugs may lead to 1:1 conduction and so this is less preferred. 
	* Anticoagulation\
	As per AF, although there is less data supporting this.
* Physical
	* Cardioversion\
	**Synchronised** at 50J.
	* Rapid atrial pacing\
	Must be faster than the atrial flutter rate.
* Procedural
	* Ablation\
	For recurrent flutter. Most effective for typical disease.
