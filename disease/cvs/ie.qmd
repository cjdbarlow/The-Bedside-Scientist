# Infective Endocarditis

Severe and life-threatening infection of cardiac skeletal structures, characterised by:

* Cardiac destruction
    * Valvular heart disease\
    Typically on the lower-pressure side (atria AV, ventricular for aortic/pulmonary) of the valve.
        * Left sided in 90%
    * Abscesses\
    Classically aortic root.
    * Perforation
    * Fistula
* Persistent bacteraemia
* Systemic embolic complications

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Risk factors:

* Cardiac
    * Abnormal valve\
    More likely to become infected, and more difficult to eradicate infection from.
        * Rheumatic
        * Degenerative
    * Intracardiac device
        * Prosthetic valve
        * Implantable wires
* Bacteraemia
    * Concurrent infection
    * IVDU 

## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

Bacterial infection predominates, common causative organisms include:

* Gram positive predominates
    * *Staphylococci*
    * *Streptococci*
    * *Enterococci*
    

Fungal endocarditis is rare, and seen with:

* Immunocompromise
* IVDU 


## Clinical Manifestations

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

**Modified Duke** criteria

## Investigations

Bloods:

* FBE
* UEC
* Blood cultures

Radiology:

* CT
    * Embolic phenomena
* MRI
    * Embolic phenomena\
    Particularly strokes. 

Echocardiography:

* Modality
    * TTE\
    * TOE\
    Better imaging of valvular structures and device leads.
* Features
    * Vegetation
    * Valvular destruction
        * Regurgitation
        * Dehisence of prosthetic valve
    * Fistula
    * Ventricular dysfunction

## Management

**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
    * Early antimicrobial therapy
        * Intravenous
        * Extended duration\
        Classically 6 weeks.

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:

* ICU admission commmon for:
    * Heart failure
    * Septic shock
    * Neurological involvment

### Surgical Intervention

Surgery is the cornerstone of curative therapy, but the decision on *when* to operate is complex and driven by the balance of delaying for pre-operative optimisation versus intervening to prevent further decline.

The decision should be multidisciplinary, but factors favouring proceeding include:

* Heart failure
    * Refractory shock/pulmonary oedema infers urgent surgery
* Uncontrolled infection\
Persistent positive blood cultures despite 3-10 (recommendations vary) days of appropriate antibiotic trreatment.
* Embolisation
    * Large (>1cm) vegetation at risk of embolising
    * New stroke\
    Decision confounded by intracranial haemorrhage, which has substantial implications for therapeutic heparin required for CPB.



### Ineffective Therapies

## Anaesthetic Considerations

## Complications

* C
    * Embolism
        * Pulmonary\
        For right sided disease.
        * Stroke\
        15-30%.
        * Splenic
        * Renal
* I
    * Sepsis

## Prognosis

Varies depending on the extent of valvular disease and severity of systemic infection, however:

* Mortality
    * 30-50% in patients receiving surgical treatment
    * 85% in those not receiving operative intervention
