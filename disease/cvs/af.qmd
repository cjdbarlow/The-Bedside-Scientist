# Atrial Fibrillation

Common arrhythmia with completely discordant atrial conduction, leading to:

* Loss of effective atrial contraction\
↓ Ventricular preload, significance depends on:
	* Ventricular function\
		* Systolic function
		* Diastolic function\
	* Ventricular rate
* Variable ventricular rates

:::column-margin

Common terms include:

* Paroxysmal AF\
Terminates within 7 days (with or without treatment) of onset
* Persistent AF\
Lasts >7 days.
* Longstanding AF\
Lasts >1 year.
* Permanent AF\
When attempts at rhythm control have stopped.
:::

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Common:

* 5% of >70s

Risk factors:

* Age
* Obesity
* OSA
* Cardiac disease
	* Atrial dilation
		* MR
		* MS
	* LV dysfunction
	* CABG\
	25-50%.
	* Cardiac failure\
	40%.

## Management

:::info
Management of AF has traditionally been divided into two competing strategies:

* **Rate control**\
Remain in AF, with controlled ventricular rate. Requires **anticoagulation**.
* **Rhythm control**\
Conversion to sinus rhythm. *May* be superior to rate control, *if* it can be achieved, and is desirable in patients:
	* <60
	* Structurally normal hearts
	* Reversible precipitant of AF
:::

:::column-margin
The rate/rhythm control debate is made more complex by the fact that rate control strategies result in SR in ~35% of patients, and rhythm control fails in 40-60% of patients. Rhythm control agents (amiodarone, flecainide) also have poorer side effect profiles than rate control agents.\
\
Overall, rhythm control is probably superior if it can be consistently achieved without requirement for heavy-duty antiarrhythmics; and so is most ideal in a young patient, without structural heart disease, and good cardiac reserve.
:::

**Resuscitation**:\

* C
	* **Electrical cardioversion** to restore SR
	**Synchronised** electrical cardioversion indicated if haemodynamically unstable.
	* Chemical cardioversion\
	Chemical cardioversion may be appropriate in the "lightly unstable" patient, whose haemodynamic state can be managed with the resources available. Options include:
		* Amiodarone\
		Variable dosing strategies described:
			* 2mg/min for 4 hours
			* 5mg/kg over 1 hour
			* 150mg over 30 minutes, followed by infusion
			Can repeat the IV load twice.
	* Acute rate control\
	May be preferred if the patient is lightly unstable



**Rhythm Control**:

* Pharmacological
	* Chemical cardioversion
		* Amiodarone
		* Flecainide\
			* 2mg/kg over 10 minutes.
			* Not suitable in structural heart disease or heart failure
		* Ibutilide\
			* 1mg over 10 minutes, followed by a repeat dose after 10 minutes
			* Risk of TDP
		* Vernakalant\
			* 3mg/kg over 10 minutes, followed by 2mg/kg over 10 minutes
			* Suitable in structural heart disease or heart failure
	* Electrical cardioversion\
	Conversion to sinus rhythm is associated with a temporary ↑ stroke risk, as any clot formed in the static atria may embolise when atrial contraction resumes. Safe electrical cardioversion
* Physical
* Procedural

**Rate Control**:

* Pharmacological
	* Chemical cardioversion

**Disposition**:

### Ineffective Therapies

## Anaesthetic Considerations

## Complications

* C
	* Haemodynamic instability
	* Rate-related cardiomyopathy\
	Reversible ↓ in LV function, occurs in ~10%.
* D
	* Stroke


## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on cause:

* Idiopathic ("lone") AF
* Post-surgical\
Significant ↑ risk of stroke, arrhythmia, ↑ hospital length of stay.
