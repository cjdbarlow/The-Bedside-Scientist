# Long QT Syndrome


Cardiac ion channel malfunction which:

* Impairs ventricular repolarisation
* Increases risk of **polymorphic ventricular tachycardia**  
Which may:
	* Resolve spontaneously
	* Degenerate to **VF**


Increased sympathetic tone may trigger VT; such triggers include:

* Exercise
* Sudden loud noises
* Emotional stress

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

Myocardial repolarisation:

* Occurs due to a combination of:
	* Outward K<sup>+</sup> flow
	* Inward Ca<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> flow  
	Partially counters K<sup>+</sup> current.
* Is not homogenous between epicardium, mid-myocardium, and endocardial cells
	* Mid-myocardium is slower due to reduced K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> channel density  
	The tail of the T-wave tends to represent repolarisation of mid-myocardial cells.
* Decreased mid-myocardial K<sup>+</sup> or increased Na<sup>+</sup> channel function in the mid-myocardium will therefore prolong the action potential
	* This may lead to late calcium inflow, and early after-depolarisations
		* If these EADs reach a threshold amplitude, VT may result

### Aetiology

May be:

* Congenital  
Multiple major genotypes have been developed, which include:
	* Jervell–Lange-Nielsen  
	Autosomal recessive.
	* Romano–Ward  
	Autosomal dominant.
* Acquired  
Likely associated with some genetic abnormality. Include:
	* Drugs
	* Electrolyte abnormalities
	* Malnutrition  
	In addition to any risk due to neurological abnormalities.
	* Neurological injury

## Clinical Manifestations

History:

* Sudden syncope
* Pseudo-seizures during exercise or stress
* Family history of sudden death

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

ECG:

* QTc >440ms  
May only be revealed in situations of physiological stress (e.g. a stress ECG).

## Management

Acute management:

* Magnesium  
Reduces EADs by increasing encouraging resting repolarisation.
	* Given as 2g MgSO<sub>4</sub> over 2-3 minutes  
	May be repeated with another 2g after 15 minutes.
	* Consider infusion of 3-20mg/min if arrhythmias persist

Medical management:

* β-blockade
* Pacing  
Increases HR and reduces QTc.
* AICD

#### Potential Precipitants

Drugs associated with development of polymorphic VT:

* Anti-arrhythmics
	* Sotalol
	* Amiodarone
	* Procainamide
	* Flecainide
	* Disopyramide
* Antibiotics
	* Erythromycin
	* Clarithromycin
	* Fluconazole
* Anti-psychotics
	* Droperidol
	* Haloperidol
* Anti-depressants
	* Fluoxetine
* Sympathomimetics
	* Ketamine

### Anaesthetic Considerations

* B
	* Maintain normocarbia
* C
	* Malignant arrhythmia
		* High risk of intraoperative arrhythmia
		* May be precipitated by increased sympathetic tone
			* Intraoperative sympatholysis is crucial
		* Cardiology review pre-operatively is ideal
	* Avoid bradycardia
	* Avoid hypotension
* E
	* Avoid reversal of neuromuscular block  
	QTc is prolonged with neostigmine-glycopyrrolate.
