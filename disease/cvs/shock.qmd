# Shock

Acute circulatory failure associated with inadequate cellular utilisation of oxygen. Shock may be classified by aetiology of circulatory disturbance:

:::column-margin
This classification is simplistic as many disease processes will cause multiple mechanisms; e.g. sepsis causes both distributive and hypovolaemic shock.
:::


* Hypovolaemic\
Loss of circulating volume, reducing preload and stroke volume. May be:
	* Blood loss
	* Fluid loss
* Obstructive\
Mechanical obstruction to flow of blood due to compression of:
	* Great veins, impeding venous return
	* Cardiac chambers
* Cardiogenic\
Loss of pump function.
* Distributive\
Loss of vascular autoregulation, leading to inappropriate allocation of cardiac output.


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

Key pathophysiological concepts in shock include:

* Oxygen delivery
* Dysoxia

### Oxygen Delivery

Delivery of oxygen to tissues is a key function of the cardiovascular system, and is given by the following equation:

:::column-margin
Practically, oxygen delivery is dependent on **three things**:

* Cardiac output
* Arterial oxygen saturation
* Haemoglobin
:::

$DO_2 = CO \times (1.34 \times [Hb] \times SpO_2 + PaO_2 \times 0.003)$, where:

* $DO_2$ is the delivery of oxygen (mL/min)\
Normal DO~2~ is ~1L/min, whilst normal VO~2~ is ~250mL/min.
* $CO$ is the Cardiac Output (L/min)
* $[Hb]$ is the arterial haemoglobin concentration (g/L)
* $SpO_2$ is the arterial oxygen saturation (%)
* $PaO_2$ is the arterial oxygen partial pressure (mmHg)


:::column-margin
The 1.34 in the oxygen delivery equation refers to millilitres of oxygen bound to each gram of haemoglobin.
:::

### Dysoxia

Dysoxia occurs when oxygen delivery is inadequate to oxygen demand. Harm from dysoxia is a function of:

* Duration\
Limited with rapid correction.
* Tissue type\
High oxygen demand and extraction organs have poor tolerance to tissue hypoxia.
	* Hypoxia sensitive:
		* Heart
		* Brain
	* Hypoxia less-sensitive:
		* Kidney
		* Skin


Dysoxia can occur when DO~2~ is apparently adequate, and results from either:

* Failure of cells to utilise available oxygen\
Sometimes referenced as histotoxic shock or cytopathic hypoxia.
* Intra-organ arteriolar shunting preventing oxygen delivery to the cell, despite adequate organ oxygen delivery\


### Aetiology

Causes by mechanism include:

* **Hypovolaemic**
	* Blood loss
		* Trauma
		* Pulmonary haemorrhage
		* GIT
		* Obstetric
		* Retroperitoneal
		* Intra-abdominal
	* Fluid loss
		* GIT losses
		* Sweating
		* Polyuria
		* Pancreatitis
		* Burns
* **Obstructive**
	* Tamponade
	* Tension pneumothorax
	* PE
	* Dynamic obstruction
* **Cardiogenic**
	* Myocardium
		* Ischaemia
			* Rupture
		* Myocarditis
		* Contusion
	* Valvular
		* Thrombus
		* Chordae rupture
	* Arrhythmia
		* Bradyarrhythmia
		* Tachyarrhythmia
* **Distributive**
	* Sepsis
	* SIRS/MODS
	* Anaphylaxis
	* Neurogenic
	* Adrenal
	* Thyroid
	* Drug toxicity

## Clinical Manifestations

Manifest as failure of end-organ perfusion:

:::column-margin
Consider the "4 W's of Shock":

* Warm
* Wakeful
* Weeing
* W(l)actate
:::

* Peripheral perfusion\
	* Temperature
	* Mottling
	* Capillary return\
	Central (sternal) is a better marker of organ perfusion and less affected by environmental conditions than peripheral perfusion.
* Altered mental state\
Anxiety, confusion, agitation, delirium, drowsiness, coma.
* Urine output\


Changes in vital signs reflects the extent of circulatory failure:

* ↑ HR
	* Early compensatory signs
	* May not be present in some conditions\
	β-blocked, bradyarrhythmias as aetiology.
* ↑ RR\
Classically ↑ during evolving shock and ↓ in the pre-terminal phase.
* ↓ BP\
Sign of significant circulatory failure, usually late onset due to effect of compensatory mechanisms.


## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

Investigations for adequacy of systemic perfusion include:

* Blood gases
	* pH
	* Lactate
	* Base deficit
* Central venous oxygen saturation


## Management

**Resuscitation**:\

* Supplemental oxygen
* Venous access
* Target MAP ⩾65mmHg:\
Exact target may vary depending on other circumstances.
	* Volume resuscitation
		* Crystalloid
		* Albumin
		* Blood
	* Vasopressors
	* Inotropes
* Arterial access
* Central venous access if required

**Specific therapy**:

* Treat precipitating cause

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:
