### Anaesthetic Considerations{#anaes}

Diabetes is included in multiple scoring systems, and is an obvious risk factor for perioperative morbidity and mortality. Key outcomes include:

* Mortality  
50% increase.
* Respiratory complications  
2.4-fold increase.
* AKI
* Infection
	* Surgical site infections
	* UTI
* Hyper- and hypo-glycaemia
* Medication errors
* Acute diabetic metabolic states
	* HHS
	* DKA


Perioperative risk is further increased in:

* Smokers
* Long duration of diabetes
* Poor glycaemic control
* Obesity
* HTN
* Increased lipids


Key Considerations:

* C
	* Cardiac risk assessment  
	Increased risk of CAD and silent ischaemia.
* D
	* Perioperative BSL  
	Surgery and anaesthesia precipitate a neuroendocrine stress response and counterregulatory hormone release  
		* Leads to insulin resistance, decreased peripheral glucose utilisation, increased lipolysis and protein catabolism
		* Significant attention must be given to perioperative management of blood glucose and hypoglycaemics
	* **Insulin dependency**  
	More important than aetiology.
	* **Diabetic therapies**  
	Agents, dose, and timing.
	* Presence of **diabetic complications**
		* Microvascular  
			* Autonomic neuropathy  
			Increases peri-induction instability of cardiovascular parameters.
		* Macrovascular
	* **Baseline** glucose **control**  
	Average, range, frequency of monitoring, and HbA1c.
		* An **HbA1c should be performed** if not done in the last **3 months**  
		Elevated HbA1c is predictive of postoperative adverse events.
			* Recommended to cancel elective surgery if HbA1c >8.5%  
			However, no evidence suggesting that reducing it improves outcome
	* **Hypoglycaemic episodes**  
	Frequency, timing, symptoms, severity.
	* **Goals** of management
		* Avoid hypo/hyperglycaemia  
		Aim BSL 6-10mmol/L.
		* Prevent DKA/HHS
		* Maintain euvolaemia
		* Aim surgery as **first on a morning list**  
		Minimises disruption to fasting.


### Perioperative Management

General Principles:

* Place patient first on an AM list
* Withhold PO hypoglycaemics  
Varies depending on size of operation and drug.
* Adjust insulin dosing  
Depends on timing of list.


### Perioperative Oral Hypoglycaemic Management

|Class|Generic Name|Recommendation|Rationale|
|---|---|
|Biguanide|Metformin|Withhold 24 hours pre-major surgery|Increase risk of lactic acidosis and tissue hypoxia if elimination impaired by renal hypoperfusion; can proceed with minor surgery if the patient has taken it|
|Sulphonylurea|Gliclazide, Glipizide, Glimepiride|Withhold day of surgery|Increase risk of hypoglycaemia|
|Glitazones|Rosiglitazone, Pioglitazone|Withhold day of surgery||
|GLP-1 agonists|Exanatide|Withhold day of surgery||
|DPP-4 inhibitors|Sitagliptin|Withhold day of surgery|Alter GI motility|
|SGLT-2 inhibitors|Dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin|Withhold for 3 days prior. Measures ketones, if **>0.6-1** then measure pH and BE and delay surgery. If acidotic and unwell, then treat as euglycaemic DKA and refer to endocrinology.|Euglycaemic DKA|

### Perioperative Insulin Management

Management of insulin depends on:

* The type of insulin
* The timing of the procedure
* Whether the patient is taking bowel preparation

|Type of Insulin|Trade Names|Day PRIOR to procedure|Morning of procedure; for an AM list|Morning of procedure; for a PM list|
|---|---|
|Short Acting|- Novorapid <br>- Humalog <br>- Actrapid<br>|- Usual doses<br>- **Half** usual dose during bowel **preparation**|- Withhold<br>- Give sliding scale|- Half usual dose with early morning breakfast|
|Intermediate Acting|- Protaphane <br>- Humulin NPH|- Give 2/3<sup>rds</sup> of usual dose<br>- **Half** usual dose during bowel **preparation**|- Withhold<br>- Give sliding scale|- Half usual dose with early morning breakfast|
|Long Acting/Basal|- Lantus<br>- Levemir|- Give 2/3<sup>rds</sup> of usual dose<br>- **Half** usual dose during bowel **preparation**|-  Give 2/3<sup>rds</sup> of usual dose<br>|- Give 2/3<sup>rds</sup> of usual dose<br>|
|Pre-mixed|- Novomix 30<br>- Humalog Mix 25/Humalog Mix 50<br>- Mixtard 30/70|- Give normal dose with dinner<br>- **Half** usual dose during bowel **preparation**|- Withhold<br>- Give sliding scale|- Half usual dose with early morning breakfast<br>- Give sliding scale|

### Perioperative Hypoglycaemia Management

> * Check BSL Q2H whilst fasting
> * Target BSL is ~7.5mmol/L, unless this is below the patients 'hypo' point


**If BSL** is:

* ⩽4 mmol/L  
	* Give glucose  
	IV preferable to maintain fasting status.
	* Notify anaesthetist
	* Recheck BSL every 15 minutes
* ≥10 mmol/L and the patient is fasting  
	* IDDM  
	Give rapid acting insulin as per [sliding scales](#slide).


Glucose options:

* Parenteral
	* 50-100mL of 10-20% dextrose
	* 1mg IM glucagon
* Enteral
	* Buccal sugar
	* 150-200mL juice
	* 90-120mL lucozade

### Perioperative Management of Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion Pumps

* Target a BSL of 6-10mmol/L  
* Give 5% dextrose (as for sliding scale insulin) whilst fasting
* If BSL:
	* <4 mmol/L  
	Withhold insulin, consider giving additional glucose.
	* ≥4 mmol/L  
	Continue insulin infusion.
	* ≥10 mmol/L  
	Administer additional short-acting insulin (as for sliding scale insulin).


### Sliding Scales{#slide}

Sliding scales should be based on the total daily insulin dose:

|BSL (mmol/L)|< 20 units/day|21-40 units/day|41-60 units/day|61-89 units/day|>90 units/day|
|--|--|
|**10-11.9**|1 unit|2 units|4 units|6 units|10 units|
|**12-15**|2 units|4 units|6 units|8 units|12 units|




## Complications

Significant risk:

* Increased perioperative risk
* Microvascular disease  
Development related to both magnitude and duration of hyperglycaemia.
	* Retinopathy
		* Background retinopathy  
		Small haemorrhages with lipid deposition at their margins.
		* Proliferative retinopathy  
		Angiogenesis of retinal vessels into vitreous, which can lead to vitreous haemorrhage and retinal detachment.
	* Nephropathy  
	Microalbuminuria, leading to proteinuria and then nephropathy.
	* Neuropathy
		* Sensory  
			* Most common
			* Paraesthesias, neuropathic pain, or simple numbness
		* Focal
		* Autonomic  
		Manifestation may occur in most organ symptoms.
			* Resting tachycardia
			* Silent ischaemia
			* Orthostatic hypotension
			* Loss of HR variability
			* Anhidrosis and failure of vasoconstriction  
			Poor heat regulation.
			* Bladder dysfunction
			* Erectile dysfunction
			* Gastroparesis
			* Constipation/diarrhoea
* Macrovascular disease
	* IHD
	* CVD
	* PVD
* Acute diabetic metabolic states
	* DKA
	* HHS
* AKI
* HTIs
* Immunosuppression  
Glycated neutrophils.



### Obstetric Complications

>Complication rate increased in women with pre-existing diabetes, rather than gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)

Maternal diabetes:

* Results in complications for both:
	* Mother
		* Increased insulin resistance  
		Increases over course of pregnancy.
		* Superimposed pre-eclampsia
		* Diabetic ketoacidosis  
		Major factor increasing perinatal morbidity and mortality.
	* Foetus
		* Placental insufficiency  
			* Uteroplacental blood flow is reduced 35-45%  
			Additional impairment if blood glucose control is poor.
			* Reduced oxygen transport on HbA<sub>1c</sub>
		* Foetal macrosomia
			* Shoulder dystocia
		* Increased foetal acidosis at delivery
		* Structural defects
			* Cardiac
			* Spina bifida
			* Limb
			* Renal agenesis


Management considerations:

* Prepartum
	* Oral glucose tolerance test  
	Required for diagnosis.
	* Screen for end-organ involvement
	* Provide instructions for fasting BSL management
* Intrapartum
	* No contraindications to regional analgesia or anaesthesia  
	Note:
		* Epidural reduces foetal metabolic acidosis
		* Greater haemodynamic disturbance with spinal  
	Likely due to higher sympathectomy.
	* Q30 minutely BSL if under GA section
* Post-partum
	* **Reduce insulin** dose **after delivery** in women with **pre-exiting DM**
	* **Cease insulin and OHGs** after delivery in women with **GDM**
