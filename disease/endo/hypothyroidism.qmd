This covers general considerations of hypothyroidism, myxoedema coma is covered at @sec-myxoedemacoma.
:::

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

Include:

* Iodine insufficiency
* Autoimmune thyroiditis
	* Hashimoto's Thyroiditis  
	Antibodies against peroxidase and thyroglobulin.
* Treatment of hyperthyroidism
* Drugs
	* Amiodarone
	* Lithium
* Pituitary failure

## Clinical Manifestations



## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

## Management

## Anaesthetic Considerations

* A
	* Tracheal compression  
	Gotires may impinge on trachea and impede airway management.
* B
	* Reduced response to ↑ CO~2~ and ↓ O~2~
* C
	* Bradydysrhythmia
	* Diastolic HTN
	* Diastolic dysfunction
	* Abnormal baroreceptor function
	* Contracted plasma volume
* D
	* Depression
	* Hypoglycaemia
	* Sensitive to anaesthetic agents
* E
	* Myxoedema coma  
	Hypothyroid crisis.
	* Hypothermia
* E~2~
	* Addisons disease  
	Occurs in 5-10% of patients with severe hypothyroidism.
* F
	* Hyponatraemia
* H
	* Anaemia
