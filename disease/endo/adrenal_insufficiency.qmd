# Adrenal Insufficiency

Adrenal insufficiency is a clinical syndrome of cortisol and aldosterone deficiency, that is classified into:

* **Primary** adrenal insufficiency (**Addison's Disease**)\
**Hypofunction** of the **adrenal cortex** resulting in ↓ in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid secretion.
* **Secondary** adrenal insufficiency\
**Hypofunction** of the **pituitary**, resulting in ↓ in ACTH and subsequent steroid release.
* **Relative** adrenal insufficiency\
**Normal function** of the **entire HPA axis**, but the **cortisone** secretion is **inadequate** for the **degree** of physiological **stress**.

Primary adrenal insufficiency is rare overall, and vanishingly rare as the cause in an ICU patient.

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

In health, the adrenal cortex is responsible for production of steroid hormones:

* Under the control of the HPA axis
	* CRH release from the hypothalamus stimulates ACTH release from the pituitary\
	Stimulation is ↑ during critical illness, resulting in ↑ plasma cortisol.
* Including:
	* Cortisol\
	Usually secreted:
		* In pulses
		* With a diurnal pattern
			* Peak at ~0800 hours
			* Trough at ~0100
		* Under the influence of ACTH\
		Negative feedback mechanism exists.
		* At 15-30mg/day
	* Aldosterone
	* Sex steroids\
	Relatively unimportant in critical illness.


### Aetiology

Primary adrenal insufficiency:

* **Autoimmune**\
Most common in Western world.
* Infections
	* **TB**\
	Most common worldwide.
	* CMV
	* Histoplasmosis
	* Coccidiomycosis
* Adrenal haemorrhage
	* Sepsis\
	Meningococcal septicaemia, also known as Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome.
	* APS
	* Trauma
	* Srugery
* Infiltrative
	* Tumour
	* Amyloid
	* Sarcoid
	* Haemachromatosis
* Drug related
	* Inhibition of cortisol synthesis
		* Etomidate
		* Fluconazole
	* Induce cortisol metabolism
		* Rifampicin
		* Phenytoin
* Congenital
	* Adrenal dysgenesis


Secondary adrenal insufficiency:

* Cessation of exogenous glucocorticoid
* Pituitary disease
	* Surgery
	* Infarction
		* Sheehan's syndrome
	* Pituitary tumour

## Clinical Manifestations

**Adrenal crisis** is a catastrophic syndrome characterised by:

* **Refractory shock**
* **Poor response** to **vasopressors**

:::column-margin
Many patients with primary deficiency will present with an adrenal crisis, due to the vague symptomatology of evolving disease.
:::

Presentation without an adrenal crisis is usually non-specific and ill-defined. Subtypes of adrenal insufficiency vary with their features:

* Primary adrenal insufficiency is the only cause that produces **hyperpigmentation**\
Only disease with ↑ ACTH production.
* Secondary adrenal insufficiency typically does not include mineralocorticoid deficiency, and remains a primarily cortisone-deficient state

: Features of Adrenal Insufficiency



## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

Bedside:

* ABG
	* NAGMA
	* Hyponatraemia
	* Hyperkalaemia

Laboratory:

* Blood
	* FBE
		* Anaemia
	* UEC
		* Hyponatraemia
		* Hyperkalaemia
	* Random cortisol\
	In adrenal crisis would be expected to be <80nmol/L; ACTH stimulation testing is not required.
	* ACTH stimulation test\
	In a stable patient:
		* Administer 250μg of tetracosactrin (Synacthen)
		* Measure cortisol at 0 and 30 minutes
		* Appropriate elevation in peak cortisol should be seen\
		Threshold varies depending on the laboratory.
			* Hydrocortisone interacts with many assays and so cannot be used
			* Dexamethasone can be used as an alternative steroid if planning the test

## Management

**Resuscitation**:\

* C
	* Volume resuscitation
	* Vasopressors
* E
	* **Glucocorticoids**

		This provides adequate mineralocorticoid replacement.

**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
* Procedural
* Physical

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:

**Preventative**:
