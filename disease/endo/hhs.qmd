# Hyperosmolar Hyperglycaemic State {#sec-hhs}


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

Similar to DKA, there is an alteration in normal carbohydrate metabolism due to **insulin deficiency**. However, *unlike* DKA there is still *some* insulin, such that:

* Hyperglycaemia still occurs
	* Due to:
		* ↑ Gluconeogenesis
		* ↓ Peripheral uptake of glucose
	* Leads to polyuria (and subsequently, polydipsia) due to the high filtered load
		* Water deficit in HHS is about twice that of DKA
* There is no ↑ in lipolysis\
Therefore, there is no ↑ free fatty acid oxidation and so generally **no ketones**.

### Aetiology

## Clinical Manifestations

Develops over **days**-weeks with:

* Polyuria
* Polydipsia
* Weakness
* Weight loss

Other symptoms include:

* Neurological symptoms\
More common in HHS than DKA, as it occurs secondary to a hyperosmolar state. Include:
	* Confusion
	* Seizures
	* Coma


## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

Features include:

* Hypovolaemia
* Severe ↑ BSL (usually >30mmol/L)
	* Without ketosis (<3mmol/L)
	* Without acidosis (pH >7.3)
* ↑ Osmoles (>320mOsmol/kg)


## Investigations

**Bedside**:

* ABG
	* ↑ BSL

**Laboratory**:

* Osmolality

**Imaging**:

**Other**:

## Management

:::priority
* Slow correction of metabolic abnormalities\
Management is ***similar* to DKA**, but should occur slowly to prevent overcorrection. 
* Fluid **resuscitation**\
Water repletion and volume resuscitation should ↑ Na^+^, ↓ BSL, and ↓ osmolality.
* **Insulin** infusion
* **Electrolyte** correction
:::


**Resuscitation**:\

* C
	* Gradual **volume resuscitation** and **water repletion**
		* Balanced crystalloid preferred
		* Change to 0.45% saline if osmolality is ↑, despite appropriately positive fluid balance
* D
	* **Insulin**\
		* Ideally delay insulin until volume resuscitation commenced and potassium is corrected\
		Glucose will by diluted by water repletion.
		* Otherwise fixed rate intravenous insulin infusion at 0.02-0.1 unit/kg/hr
		* Commence insulin at 0.02-0.05 unit/kg/hr, targeting 10-15mmol/L in the initial setting
* F
	* Electrolyte correction
		* **Potassium**
			* Begin correction of total body deficit once serum potassium is <5.5mmol/L
			* Consider **only initiating insulin** when **potassium** is **>3.3mmol/L** to avoid precipitating severe hypokalaemia


**Supportive care**:

* F
	* Magnesium\
	Often deplete, PRN replenishment is sufficient.
	* Phosphate

**Disposition**:

* ICU admission for:
	* Neurological symptoms
		* GCS <12
	* Severe electrolyte derangements

**Preventative**:

* Appropriate insulin administration
	* Baseline maintenance
	* ↑ Dosing in times of physiologic stress


### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

## Anaesthetic Considerations

## Complications

* Aspiration
* D
	* ↓ BSL
	* CVA
	* Cerebral oedema
* F
	* ↓ K^+^
* H
	* DVT

:::column-margin
Hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia are the most common serious complication, due to excessive insulin replacement with inadequate potassium supplementation.
