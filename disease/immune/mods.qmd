# Multiorgan Dysfunction Syndrome

Severe derangement of multiple organ systems occurring secondary to an acute disease process.

:::column-margin
This is related to, but distinct from, SIRS; as SIRS does not necessarily imply organ dysfunction.

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

:::info
The syndrome has also been described as: multiorgan failure, multiple system failure, and shock lung.

## Pathophysiology

Poorly understood, but includes multiple factors (predominantly functional) including:

* Inflammatory dysfunction
	* Compensatory Anti-Inflammatory Response Syndrome\
	State of immunosuppression secondary to exaggerated expression of anti-inflammatory mediators.
* Coagulopathy
* Circulatory dysfunction
	* Macrocirculatory dysfunction\
	Often shock states with normal or high DO~2~.
	* Microcirculatory dysfunction
* Mitochondrial dysfunction
* Neurohumoral and endocrine dysfunction

### Aetiology

Any disease that causes tissue damage can lead to MODS, however particular risk factors include:

* CVS
	* Cardiac arrest
	* Extracorporeal circulation
		* Bypass
			* Circulatory arrest
		* ECMO
* Metabolic
	* Hyperthermia
* GIT
	* Pancreatitis
* Infection
* Obstetric
	* Eclampsia
* Toxins
* Major trauma
	* Massive transfusion
	* Burns

## Management

Treatment is fundamentally good, **early**, supportive care. Principles include:

* Early recognition of illness
* Early resuscitation
* Early definitive treatment
* Prevention of secondary injury
