# Epidermal Necrolysis

**Severe** immune-mediated epidermal necrosis and **desquamation at ⩾2 distinct sites** that is divided by extent of skin involvement into:

* **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome**\
<10% BSA.
* SJS/TEN Overlap syndrome\
10-30% BSA.
* **Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis**\
\>30% BSA.


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Epidemiology:

* Annual incidence ~5/1,000,000.


Risk factors:

* ↑ Age
* Female sex
* HIV
* Connective tissue disease
* Malignancy


## Pathophysiology

T-cell mediated reaction:

* Drug-specific CD8+ T-cells are activated
* Cytotoxic proteins released
* Epidermal necrolysis released


### Aetiology

Precipitants include:

* **Medications**\
Most cases are due to an idiosyncratic reaction to certain families of medications that:
	* Are usually commenced between 1 week and 1 month prior
	* Include:
		* Antibiotics
			* Amoxacillin/ampicillin
			* Fluoroquinolones
			* Sulfamethoxazole
			* Doxycycline
			* Rifampicin
		* Antiepileptics
			* Carbamazepine
			* Lamotrigine
			* Phenobarbital
			* Phenytoin
		* NSAIDs
* **Infection**
	* *Mycoplasma*
* Idiopathic

## Assessment

* Identify the potential causative agents
* Assess the degree of skin loss

:::column-margin
Assessment principles are similar to @sec-burns.
:::

### History

Prodromal symptoms:

* Malaise
* Fever
* Sore throat
* Conjunctivitis


### Examination

Mucocutaneous features:

:::column-margin
![Bullae](/resources/sjs_bullae.png)
:::

* Lesions typically begin on the face and thorax
* **Symmetrically distributed**
* Typically begin as flaccid bullae
* Progress to "sheet-like" detachment of skin
* **Mucosal involvement** in 80%
* **Genital involvement** in 70%
* **Corneal involvement** in >60%

The **Nikolsky sign** is positive if epidermal detachment can be extended with gentle lateral pressure.

### Investigations

**Bedside**:

**Laboratory**:

**Imaging**:

**Other**:

* Skin biopsy

### Diagnostic Approach and DDx

Disease occurs in two phases:

* **Acute phase**\
5-7 period of worsening desquamation and mucositis. Risk of:
	* Hypovolaemia
		* Haemoconcentration
		* AKI
	* Sepsis
	* Multiorgan failure
	* Death
* **Chronic phase**\
Convalescence and recovery.


Key differentials:

* Erythema multiforme
* Drug eruptions

## Management

:::priority
* **Treat precipitant**
* Transfer to burns centre
* 
:::

:::column-margin
Resuscitation and supportive care has many similarities to burns, and is covered under @sec-burns.
:::

**Resuscitation**:

* A
	* Intubation\
	May be required if mucosal involvement


**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
	* Cease offending agent
* Procedural
* Physical
	* Specific ocular care\
		* Ocular rinses
		* Lubricants
		* Conjunctival adhesion separation
			* Glass rod
			* Forceps
	* Specific genital care\
	Risk of fibrosis with adjacent skin edges, consider:
		* Topical corticosteroid
		* Silicone vaginal dilators
		* IDC placement
		* Regular foreskin retraction


**Supportive care**:

* D
	* Multimodal analgesia
* F
	* Volume resuscitation\
	Prevent hypovolaemia.
* G
	* Early EN\
	May need 25-30kcal/kg/day due to ↑ metabolism.
	* Stress ulcer prophylaxis
* H
	* Thromboprophylaxis
* I
	* Wound dressings
		* Non-adhesive

**Disposition**:

**Preventative**:


### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

Systemic immunomodulation therapy has limited evidence, however there is potential benefit from may:

* Pulse steroids\
May be more effective when commenced early in disease onset.
* IVIG\
1-2g/kg/day.
* Ertanercept\
TNF-α inhibition.


Non-recommended agents include:

* Thalidomide

## Anaesthetic Considerations

## Complications

* Death\
~25%, with ↑ mortality with ↑ desquamation.
* B
	* Lung injury\
	Direct bronchial sloughing.
	* HAP/VAP
	* 
* F
	* AKI
		* Pre-renal
* G
	*
