# Sarcoidosis


Multisystem inflammatory disease characterised by **tissue infiltration** with monocytes, T-lymphocytes, and **non-caeseating granulomas**.

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Prevalence: ~5/100,000


## Pathophysiology



### Aetiology

Unknown, likely to be genetic susceptibility combined with an environmental trigger leading to an inflammatory response.

## Clinical Manifestations

Common:

* Constitutional
	* Malaise
	* Fever
	* Weight loss
* Pulmonary
	* Cough
	* Dyspnoea


System involvement:

* Airway
	* Muscosal infiltration in ~5%
* Respiratory  
Occurs in over 90%.
	* Classified into:
		* Isolated hilar disease
		* Adenopathy and parenchymal involvement
		* Parenchymal involvement without adenopathy
		* Pulmonary fibrosis
	* Parenchymal changes are classically peribronchial and perivascular
* Cardiac
	* Conduction disease
		* Supraventricular arrhythmias
		* Prolonged QT and ventricular arrhythmias
		* PVCs
	* Cardiomyopathy
		* Failure
* CNS
	* Eye involvement  
		* Chronic anterior uveitis
	* Cranial nerve involvement
* Renal	
	* Acute granulomatous interstitial nephritis
	* Nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis  
	Calcium deposition subsequently leading to chronic renal failure.
* Hepatic
	* Cholestasis
	* Hepatic failure
	* Portal hypertension
* Haematological  
40%.
	* Anaemia
	* Leukopaenia


## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

## Management

Treatment modifies course:

* Steroids  
First-line.
* Alternative immunosuppression  
Used if disease progresses despite steroids, or steroids are not tolerated. Evidence is poor. Options include:
	* Methotrexate
	* Azathioprine
	* Cyclophosphamide
	* Mycophenolate

### Medical

### Surgical

### Anaesthetic Considerations

* A
	* Airway nodules
* B
	* Respiratory involvement
* C
	* Conduction abnormalities
	* Pulmonary hypertension
	* Cardiomyopathy
* E
	* Steroid use
		* Cushingoid features
* F
	* Hypercalcaemia

### Ineffective Therapies

## Complications

## Prognosis

High variable, including:

* Spontaneous resolution  
Unlikely if it persists over 5 years.
* Protraction  
Death:
	* Pulmonary
	* Cardiac
	* Neurological


## Key Studies
