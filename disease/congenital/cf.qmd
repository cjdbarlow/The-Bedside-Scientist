# Cystic Fibrosis


Multisystem genetic disorder with a heterogenous phenoytype affecting the CFTR channel, reducing chloride levels and increasing viscosity of mucous across multiple organ systems, though most significantly in the lungs.


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors



## Pathophysiology

Changes to the CFTR gene alter chloride conductance through the CFTR channel.

### Aetiology

Genetic disease:

* Mendelian recessive inheritance
* Heterozygotes are asymptomatic
* Highly variable mutations and severity  
Over 1100 described mutations.

## Clinical Manifestations

Multiorgan manifestations:

* Respiratory  
Increased mucous viscosity and decreased mucociliary clearance, leading to:
	* Chronic sinusitis
	* Recurrent LRTI  
	Chronic colonisation with atypical pathogens.
	* Obstructive lung disease  
	Subsequent:
		* Bronchiectasis
		* Gas trapping
	* Chronic hypoxaemia
		* Cor pulmonale
* MSK
	* Osteoporosis  
	Impaired calcium absorption.
	* Impaired thermoregulation
* GIT
	* Meconium ileus
	* Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome
	* Biliary obstruction  
		* Biliary cirrhosis
		* Portal HTN
	* Pancreatic obstruction
		* Pancreatic exocrine deficiency
		* Diabetes  
		Most common non-respiratory comorbidity.
* GU
	* Male infertility

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

Diagnosis requires:

* Clinical features
* Laboratory evidence
	* Positive sweat test
	* CFTR gene abnormality

## Investigations

Post-natal screening:

* Trypsinogen  
High false-positive rate.
* Sweat test  
Performed two weeks after birth.

Genetic testing:

* Evaluates the 11 most common CF mutations
* ~92% sensitive


## Management

Medical management is primarily supportive:

* Respiratory  
Aims to decrease incidence and duration of respiratory tract infections. Includes:
	* Daily respiratory physiotherapy
	* Bronchodilators
	* Mucolytics  
	e.g. Hypertonic saline.
	* Antibiotics  
	* Anti-inflammatories  
	Including inhaled or systemic corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and azithromycin.
	* CFTR modulators
		* Ivacaftor  
		Potentiates chloride channel function in a large subset of CFTR mutations.

Surgical management:

* Lung transplantation  
Requires bilateral due to suppurative disease.
 
### Anaesthetic Considerations

Day surgery is usually inappropriate, but can be considered if:

* Stable disease
* Good baseline function

Preoperative investigations should include:

* CXR
* Bloods
	* FBE
	* UEC
	* LFTs
	* BSL
	* Coags

* A
	* Airway choice
		* Spontaneous ventilation on LMA may reduce adverse GA effects on respiratory mechanics for short procedures
		* ETT facilitates tracheal suctioning and controlled gas exchange
		* Avoid nasal ETT where possible due to high incidence of nasal polyposis
	* Extubation early post-operatively
* B
	* Obstructive lung disease  
	Postoperative complications predicted by:
		* FEV~1~ â©½60%
		* PCO~2~ >50mmHg
* D
	* Volatile anaesthesia has greater bronchodilation than TIVA
* E
	* Ensure complete reversal of neuromuscular blocker
* C
	* Cor pulmonale
* I
	* Requirement for isolation

### Ineffective Therapies

## Complications

## Prognosis

Poor prognostic factors include:

* Chronic pseudomonas infection  
Increased rate of pulmonary decline, decreased survival.
* Pulmonary hypertension
