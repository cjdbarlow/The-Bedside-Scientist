# Chiari Malformations


Family of disorders characterised by anomalies cranio-cervical junction and downward displacement of the cerebellar contents. Divided into 4 types:

* Chiari Type I
	* Tonsillar herniation >5mm below the foramen magnum
	* No associated brainstem herniation or supratentorial anomalies
	* Low frequency of hydrocephalus
	* Often diagnosed in adulthood or adolescence
* Chiari Type II (Arnold-Chiari Malformation)
	* Caudal herniation of the vermis, brainstem, and 4^th^ ventricle
	* Associated with:
		* Myelomengingocele
		* Brain anomalies
		* Hydrocephalus
		* Syringomyelia
	* Usually diagnosed prenatally or at birth
* Chiari Type III
	* Occipital encephalocele  
	Containing dysmorphic cerebellar and brainstem tissues.
	* High mortality in infancy  	
	Due to respiratory failure.
* Chiari Type IV
	* Hypoplastic or aplastic cerebellum


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

## Clinical Manifestations

May be asymptomatic.

Clinical features include:

* Cranial nerve palsies
* Syringomyelia
* Myelopathy
* Cerebellar symptoms
* Neck pain
* Occipital headache

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

Diagnosis is based upon imaging alone.

## Investigations

Imaging:

* CT
* MRI

## Management

Medical management focuses on:

* Respiratory failure
* Feeding difficulties
* Neurogenic bowel
* Neurogenic bladder

Surgery:

* Aims to decompress cranio-cervical junction and restore normal CSF flow across the foramen magnum

### Anaesthetic Considerations

* A
	* Atlanto-axial instability
* D
	* ICP  
	Hydrocephalus.
	* Myelomeningocele  
	May lead to:
		* Hypovolaemia  
		Losses from defect.
		* Infection
		* Heat loss
