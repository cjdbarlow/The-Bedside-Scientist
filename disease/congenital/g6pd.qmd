# G6PD Deficiency {#sec-G6PD}

G6PD is an X-linked **enzyme deficiency** that causes **extravascular haemolysis** under conditions of **oxidative stress**, notably:

* Physiological stress
	* Surgery
	* Sepsis
	* DKA
* Foods
	* Fava beans\
	Known as Favism.
	* Blueberries
* Drugs
	* Methylene blue
	* Antibiotics
		* Cotrimoxazole
		* Sulfamethoxazole
		* Nitrofurantoin
		* Fluoroquinolones
		* Primaquine
	* Rasburicase

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

* **G6PD** is an enzyme that **reduces NADP^+^ to NADPH** by oxidising glucose-6-phosphate
* **NADPH** is **used** to **regenerate glutathione**, which is used by erythrocytes to **repair oxidative damage**
* Inadequate NADPH production results in:
	* Glutathione depletion
	* Unrepaired oxidative stress\
	Evident as inclusions, such as **Heinz** and **Howel-Jolly bodies**.
	* **Extravascular haemolysis** by the reticuloendothelial system
		* Anaemia
		* Jaundice
