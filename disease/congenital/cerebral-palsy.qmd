# Cerebral Palsy


Cerebral palsy is a collective term describing a **heterogenous** group of **neurological disorders** occurring due to **non-progressive** brain damage. Cerebral Palsy is:

* Characterised by varying impediments to function:
	* Motor
	* Sensory
	* Intellectual
* Divided into two types
	* Congenital  
	80% of cases.
	* Acquired  
	20% of cases, develops during the first 2 years of life. May be due to:
		* ICH
		* Encephalitis/Meningitis
		* Trauma
		* Seizures

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Prevalence:

* Occurs in ~1/500 live births  
Relatively constant despite improves in obstetric care, likely due to increased survival of premature  infants.


Risk factors:

* Foetal pathogenic factors
	* Microcephaly
	* Trauma
	* Low birth weight
	* Prematurity
	* Peripartum hypoxia  
	~6% of cases.
	* Low APGAR score
	* Prenatal TORCH infections
* Maternal pathogenic factors
	* Breech
	* Pre-eclampsia
	* Peripartum haemorrhage
	* Maternal hyperthyroidism
	* Foetal alcohol syndrome




## Pathophysiology

Disruption of normal developmental changes in brain structure and organisation from a variety of potential causes, although clasically due to foetal hypoxia occurring during development or delivery.

## Clinical Manifestations

* Motor
	* Muscle spasticity  
	Present in 80% of patients.
		* Leads to contractures due to differential growth between long bones and spastic muscle groups
	* Fixed flexion deformities
* Sensory
	* Visual/auditory impairment
	* Abnormal touch and pain perception
* Intellectual impediment  
Impairment present in 60%.
	* May be difficult to separate from motor problems affecting phonation

### Grading

Categorised using the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS):

* Evaluates mobility
* Generally will not improve after 5<sup>th</sup> year of life
* Uses five categories:
	* Level 1
		* Can walk, run, and climb stairs without rails
		* Limited speed, balance, and coordination
	* Level 2
		* Walk in most setting, climb stairs without rails
		* Limited by long distance, uneven terrain, confined or crowded spaces
	* Level 3
		* Walk with mobility device indoors, climb stairs with rails
		* Wheelchairs for distance
	* Level 4
		* Physical assistance or motorised wheelchairs in most settings
	* Level 5
		* Transported in manual wheelchair in all settings
		* Limited ability to maintain antigravity head and trunk postures

## Management

Treatment is supportive, and consists of:

* Improving posture
	* Reducing spasticity and spasms
		* Antispasmodics  
		Baclofen.
		* Denervation techniques
			* Botulinum toxin
			* Radiofrequency ablation of dorsal horn ganglia
	* Alleviating contractures
		* Tenotomies
		* Osteotomies
		* Tendon transfer/lengthening
* Treatment of coexistent disease

### Anaesthetic Considerations

* SET
	* HDU/ICU desirable  
	Prone to:
		* Hypoxia
			* Aspiration
			* Atelectasis
		* Hypovolaemia
		* Hypothermia
* A
	* High aspiration risk  
	* Risk of loose teeth/poor dental hygiene
* B
	* Respiratory impairment  
	Combination of muscular weakness, skeletal deformities, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia.
* C
	* Co-existent cardiac disease
	* Generally limited cardiorespiratory reserve
* D
	* Difficulty communicating
	* Co-existent epilepsy  
	Continue antiepileptics in perioperative period.
	* **Analgesia** very important and can be difficult to manage
		* Difficult due to nature of surgery and communication
		* Continuous analgesia preferred
		* **Muscular spasm** can be painful and debilitating
			* Diazepam 0.05-0.1mg/kg Q4H
		* Epidural or regional techniques excellent to reduce spasm, pain, and opioid demand		
* E
	* Fixed flexion deformities  
	Limit or restrict positioning.
	* Risk of hypothermia  
	Due to low levels of body fat and muscle.
	* **Use of muscle relaxants**
		* No restriction on suxamethonium
		* Offset of non-depolarising agent is increased due to upregulation of ACh receptors
* G
	* GORD  
	Risk of aspiration.
* H
	* Increased blood loss  
	CP muscle contracts poorly when incised, leading to much greater volumes of blood loss.
		* **Group and save** for any major surgery

## Complications

Associated conditions:

* Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome
* Respiratory impairment
	* Scoliosis and spinal deformities
	* Restrictive lung disease  
	May in turn lead to pulmonary hypertension, and right heart/respiratory failure.
* GORD/recurrent aspiration  
In turn associated with chronic lung injury from repeated aspiration. May be due to:
	* Swallowing difficulties
	* Oesophageal dymotility
	* Spinal deformities
	* Weak cough
* Epilepsy  
50% may have focal or generalised forms.
