# Massive Haemoptysis


> This is an <span style="color:red">**anaesthetic crisis**</span>\
> Priority is to:
>* **Decontaminate the airway**
>* **Maintain oxygenation**

Large haemorrhage into the pulmonary tree which:

* Is variably defined as 100-1000mL of haemoptysis/day
* May precipitate cardiac arrest secondary to **hypoxia**

##<span style="color:red">Emergency Management</span>

Immediately:

* **Protect airway**
	* Large, **single-lumen** ETT
		* Suction catheter/bronchoscopic decontamination
	* Consider lung isolation
		* Bronchial blocker\
			* May be passed outside the ETT and placed under bronchoscopic guidance
			* Consider use of a 14Fr Fogarty catheter
		* Endobronchial tube
* Haemodynamic resuscitation\
	* Cardiac arrest is common
	* Hypoxia is almost always the cause
	* Hypovolaemia is rarely significant

Definitive treatment:

* Source control\
Options include:
	* Rigid bronchoscopy
	* Interventional angiography\
	Bronchial angiography and embolisation.\
		* Note risk of paralysis due to loss of spinal perfusion
	* Thoracotomy
* Correction of coagulopathy




## Epidemiology and Risk Factors


## Pathophysiology

* 90% of haemorrhage comes from the bronchial circulation\
These bleeds are dependent on ***systemic* blood pressure**.

### Aetiology

Causes can be divided into:

* Airway
* Trauma
	* Suction
	* Foreign body
	* Tracheo-arterial fistula
	* Blunt/penetrating
* Primary lung disease
	* **Infective**
		* Mycobacterial
		* Fungal
		* Lung abscess
		* Parasitic
			* Hydatid cyst
			* Paragonimiasis
		* Necrotising pneumonia\
		*Staphylococcus*, *Klebsiella*, *Legionella*.
	* **Neoplasm**
		* Primary
		* Metastases
		* Sarcoma
* Cardiac
	* LV failure
	* Mitral stenosis
* Vascular
	* Vasculitis
		* Wegener's granulomatosis
		* Behcet's disease 
	* Vascular
		* AVM
		* PE
* Coagulopathy
	* von Willebrand's Disease
	* Haemophilias
	* Anticoagulants
	* Thrombocytopenia
* Iatrogenic
	* PAC
	* Bronchoscopy
	* Biopsy
	* Transtracheal aspiration

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

## Management

Medical:

* If related to PAC:\
Withdraw catheter slightly and reinflate to provide proximal compression, prior to surgical resection.

Interventional:

* Bronchial artery embolisation
	* Used for life-threatening haemoptysis
	* Failure in up to 10%
* Surgical resection\
Treatment of choice when site is localised and patient can tolerate resection.

### Anaesthetic Considerations

### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies
