# Organising Pneumonia

:::info
Formerly known as bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia (BOOP).
:::

Inflammatory lung disease characterised by granulation in small airways and alveoli that occurs:

* With no obvious cause\
Cryptogenic organising pneumonia.
* Previous alveolar injury


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Rare:

* ~1-5/100,000

## Pathophysiology

Poorly understood, features include:

* Inflammation
* Intra-alveolar fibroproliferation
	* May be reversible
* Fibrinous remodelling

### Aetiology

* Idiopathic
* Post-infectious
* Drugs
* Connective tissue disorders
* Transplantation
* Malignancy
* Radiotherapy
* Industrial chemical exposure

## Clinical Features

Typically subacute:

* Weeks-months
* Dry cough
* Dyspnoea
	* WOrseend by exertion
* Flu-like symptoms

## Assessment

### History

### Exam

### Investigations

**Bedside**:

* Bronchoscopy
	* BAL\
	To evaluate for eiosinophlic pneumonia and alveolar haemorrhage.

**Laboratory**:

**Imaging**:

![Organising Pneumonias](/resources/cop.jpeg)
:::

* CXR
	* Consolidative opacities with normal lung volumes\
	Figure A.
* CT
	* Multifocal consolidation
	* Peripheral nodulation\
	Figure C.
	* Migratory opacities\
	Figure D and E are the same patient at different time points.
	* Atoll sign\
	Rim of consolidation with central ground-glass opacities, which is rare but highly specific.

**Other**:

### Diagnostic Approach and DDx

Key differentials include:

* CAP\
Absence of antibiotic response suggests organising pneumonia.
* Hypersensitivity pneumonitis
* Eosinophilic pneumonia
* Alveolar haemorrhage
* Vasculitis
* Pulmonary lymphoma
* Invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma


## Management

:::priority
* Immunosuppression
*:::


**Resuscitation**:

**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
	* Corticosteroids\
	1mg/kg prednisolone daily up to 60mg per day, for 2-4 weeks followed by a 3-5 month taper.
* Procedural
* Physical

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:

**Preventative**:
