# Bronchopleural Fistulae


Air leak occurring between airways and the pleural space, and are divided into:

* Alveolar/parenchymal-pleural
* Bronchopleural\
From the tracheobronchial tree.
	* Typically presents with persistent pneumothorax or immediate large air leak

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

Physiological effects depend on:

* Presence of ICC\
	* In absence of an ICC, the pleural pressure will equalise with atmospheric and the lung will collapse under its own elastic recoil\
		* A tension pneumothorax may develop if the fistula behaves as a one-way valve
	* An ICC will demonstrate continuous air leak, and the lung may only partially reinflate (if at all)
* Size of fistulae
	* Large fistulae lead to preferential flow via fistulae and reduction in:
		* Alveolar ventilation
		* FRC


Alteration in lung function:

* Lung collapse and subsequent hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction tend to limit shunt, and **hypoxia is not a common feature** of uncomplicated fistula
* Dead space leads to respiratory acidosis
* ↑ work of breathing due to requirement to generate a more negative intrapleural pressure m 
* Decrecruitment of unaffected lung due to failure to maintain auto-PEEP

### Aetiology

Alveolar/parenchymal-pleural:

* Pulmonary disease
	* COAD
	* Infections
	* Tumour
* Iatrogenic
	* Volutrauma\
	Note that alveolar **do not** tend to rupture through the pleural membrane, and instead air dissects along bronchovascular sheaths to the mediastinum. Pneumomediastinum then further dissects to create subcutaneous emphysema or pneumothorax.
	* Radiotherapy


Bronchopleural:

* Trauma
	* Penetrating
	* Blunt
		* Overpressure with a closed glottis\
		Usually causes rupture within 2cm of carina.
		* Rapid A-P compression
		* Acceleration-deceleration injury\
		Traction of lungs against a fixed carina.
* Iatrogenic\
Common post thoracic surgery.


## Clinical Manifestations

Respiratory:

* Acidosis
* ↑ work of breathing
	* Air hunger
	* Dyspnoea
	* Tachypnoea

### Anaesthetic Considerations

* B
	* **ICC** placed and patent\
		* Obstructed ICC will lead to tension pneumothorax with IPPV
		* Chest drain should be large enough to adequately ventilate pleural space\
		32Fr ICC is large enough to drain up to 15L/min of fistula flow on 10cmH~2~O of suction.
		* If drain has been on suction on the ward, continue suction during anaesthetic induction
	* **Effective size** of fistulae\
	Combination of physical size and effect on distribution of ventilation and fistulae gas flow.
		* Determines effect of positive pressure ventilation on fistulae flow
		* Compliant lungs and a small fistula favours pulmonary ventilation
		* Non-compliant lungs and a large fistula favours fistula flow\
		This leads to inadequate alveolar ventilation.
		* ↑ size of fistula suggested by:
			* Respiratory distress
			* Volume of gas draining
				* Only with coughing 
				Suggests small or trivial.
				* Expiration only\
				Suggests moderate size.
				* Inspiration and expiration\
				Suggests large.
			* Imaging
				* Complete ipsilateral lung collapse despite ICC and suction
	* **Induction** strategies
		* Small fistulae are amenable to conventional induction
		* Large fistulae require maintenance of spontaneous ventilation until fistulae isolation\
			* Reduction in FRC and difficulty effectively ventilating the patient can occur when initiating IPPV
			* Spontaneously ventilating induction required to maintain alveolar ventilation
				* Volatile or propofol infusion and DLT or SLT
					* Consider a small dose of midazolam with induction
					* Consider gentle pressure support
					* Topicalise with 10-15ml 2% lignocaine to mouth and tracheobronchial tree
					* Consider propofol (0.5mg/kg) or short-acting opioid (alfentanil 10-15μg/kg) prior to laryngoscopy\
					Noting possibility for apnoea.
					* Place airway device into proximal trachea
					* Advance tube under bronchoscopic vision
				* Awake intubation with SLT and endobronchial intubation or blocker
