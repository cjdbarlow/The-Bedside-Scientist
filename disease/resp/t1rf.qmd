**Resuscitation**:

**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
* Procedural
* Physical

**Supportive care**:

**Preventative**:


### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

## Anaesthetic Considerations

## Complications

## Key Studies

**Extracorporeal CO~2~ removal**:

* Lung protective ventilation is effective in â†“ VILI but causes respiratory acidosis
* Extracorporeal CO~2~ removal is less invasive than ECMO and can clear significant amounts of CO~2~, but not provide significant oxygenation
