# Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease


COPD is a chronic, progressive inflammatory disease characterised by persistent respiratory symptoms with incompletely reversible airflow limitation. COPD:

* Affects airways, lung parenchyma, and vasculature
* Impairs expiration via:
	* Poorly reversible airway narrowing
	* Airway smooth muscle remodelling
	* ↑ mucous production
* Includes bullous disease


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Common comorbidity:

* 10% of >40s woldwide
* 4th most common cause of death
* Associated with:
	* CAD
	* Malignancy
	* Depression

Risk factors:

* Environmental exposures:
	* **Smoking**
		* **Cigarettes**
		* Pipes/cigars
		* Water pipe
		* Marijuana\
		Greater incease in bullous emphysema due to holding hot inhaled smoke.
	* Occupational exposures
		* Dusts
		* Chemical agents
		* Fumes
	* Indoor air pollution
		* Cooking fuels
	* Outdoor air pollution  
	Relatively small effect.
* Genetic factors:
	* FAM13A associated with development

Degree of decline in FEV~1~ with age varies with the duration of smoking, timing of quitting smoking, and susceptibility to COPD.

## Pathophysiology

Expiratory airflow limitation via:

* ↑ airway resistance:
	* Obstructive bronchiolitis  
	Small airway inflammation leads to gas trapping and dynamic hyperinflation.
	* ↑ Secretion production
	* Bronchospasm
	* Parenchymal destruction  
	Leading to emphysema, which reduces:
		* Pulmonary capillary bed volume
		* Lung surface area for gas exchange
		* V/Q matching
* Loss of elastic recoil\
Combination of elastin destruction and fall in alveolar surface tension.
	* ↓ Expiratory air flow
	
Air flow limitaiton leads to:

* Prolonged expiration
* Pulmonary hyperinflation
* ↑ work of breathing
* Dyspnoea	

### Aetiology

## Assessment

Key symptoms are:

* Chronic cough or sputum production
* History of exposures
* Dyspnoea  
Graded using the mMRC scale.



:::column-margin

|MRC Grade|Breathlessness|
|--|--|
|**Grade 0**|Only with strenuous exercise|
|**Grade 1**|When hurrying or a slight incline|
|**Grade 2**|Slower than people of same age, or stopping due to shortness of breath on flat ground|
|**Grade 3**|After ~100m or a few minutes on flat ground|
|**Grade 4**|I am too breathless to leave the house, or get breathless when dressing/undressing|

### GOLD Criteria

Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease Criteria:

* Used clinically to determine severity of disease in order to prognosticate and guide therapeutic interventions
* Not appropriate for diagnosis
* Are based upon:
	* Symptom burden  
	mMRC score.
	* Number of exacerbations and hospital admissions
	* FEV~1~


Treatment recommendations:

* GOLD A  
Bronchodilator (LABA or SABA) offered, and continued if effective.
* GOLD B  
LABA or long-acting methacholine antagonist should be offered as initial therapy.
* GOLD C  
LAMA as initial therapy, and benefit may be seen with LAMA & LABA & inhaled corticosteroids.
* GOLD D  
LAMA & LABA as initial therapy, with inhaled corticosteroids for patients with frequent exacerbations.


## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

Diagnosis should be considered in:

* Smokers
* Age >35
* Exertional breathlessness
* Chronic cough
* Frequent winter bronchitis or wheeze

Differentials include:

* Chronic asthma\
Long-term dyspnoea from childhood, with obvious precipitants. Normal TLCO with reversibility.
* Late-onset asthma\
Associated with GORD. Normal TLCO with reversibility.
* Broncholitis obliterans

## Investigations

Respiratory function tests are diagnostic and used to grade severity:

* **FEV~1~/FVC of ⩽0.7**
	* Reversibility is not required  
	Differentiated from asthma on clinical grounds.
* Severity graded by FEV~1~  
Multiple grading systems, the GOLD 2008/NICE 2010 system:
	* FEV~1~ ⩾80% predicted  
	Mild.
	* FEV~1~ 50-79% predicted  
	Moderate.
	* FEV~1~ 30-49% predicted  
	Severe.
	* FEV~1~ ⩽30% predicted  
	Very severe.

Bloods:

* α-1 antitrypsin\
All patients should be screened once for α1 antitrypsin deficiency. ⩽20% is suggestive of homozygous deficiency.
* ABG/VBG\
Evaluate degree of chronic hypercapnoea and metabolic compensation.

Radiology:

* CXR\
Hyperinflation if >=10 posterior ribs visible.


## Management

Physical:

* Smoking cessation\
Vital, and will slow down deterioration and disability before death occurs.
* NIV  
Reduces chronic hypercarbia, survival, and readmission rates.
* Home oxygen\
Indicated in patients with severe resting hypoxia (PaO~2~ <60mmHg, or ⩽55mmHg with cor pulmonale or pulmonary hypertension).


Pharmacological:

* Inhaled therapies  
Mainstay of day-to-day treatment. Includes:
	* Short-acting bronchodilators  
	For breathlessness and exercise limitation.
	* Long-acting bronchodilators  
	For persistent breathlessness.
* Oral therapy  
Regular oral corticosteroids may be requried in advanced disease.
* Vaccination  
Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines ↓ LRTI rate.


Procedural:

* Lung volume reduction surgery  
Improves survival in severe upper-lobe emphysema and low post-rehabilitation exercise capacity.
* Bullectomy  
Improves dyspnoea, lung function, and exercise tolerance is selected patients.
* Lung transplantation  
Improves quality of life in selected patients with very severe COAD.
* Bronchoscopic interventions  
Includes coils and endobronchial valves, and improves exercise tolerance and lung function at 6-12 months following treatment.


### Acute Exacerbation of COPD

Acute change in degree of dyspnoea, cough, or sputum production. Acute exacerbations are:

* The most common admission diagnosis in the UK (~16%)
* Usually survivable in the short term but a poor prognostic sign for survival in the medium-long term\
Up to 90% hospital survival, but significantly impaired 2-3 year survival.

Precipiated by:

* Infection
	* Most commonly bacterial:\
	80% caused by:
		* *S. Pneumoniae*
		* *H. Influenze*
	* Viral isolated in 20-30%:
		* Rhinovirus
		* Influenze
		* Parainfluenzae	
* Sputum retention
* Cardiac failure
* Other respiratory disease
	* Pneumothorax
* Uncontrolled oxygen therapy\
Relative hyperoxia (>92%) may adversely affect V/Q matching, reduce hypoxic drive, and ↑ CO~2~ dissociation via the Haldane effect.



Physical: 

* **Oxygen**\
Target SpO~2~ 88-92%.
* **HFNO**
* **NIV**\
Preferred over invasive ventilation, and indicated when:
	* Uncompensated respiratory acidosis
	* Severe dyspnoea with signs of fatigue
	* Persistent hypoxaemia despite supplemental oxygen
* Chest physio
	* Encourage **coughing**
	* Bubble **PEEP**
* **Invasive ventilation**\
Reasonable in patients without end-stage lung disease - 80-90% wean successfully. Avoid breath stacking.
	* Suggested initial settings to avoid breath stacking
		* PEEP 3-8cmH~2~O
		* Psup 8-15cmH~2~O
		* RR <14\
		Aim MV <115mL/kg.
	* Minimise dynamic hyperinflation by:
		* Watching the flow-volume loop
		* Measuring end-inspiratory pause\
		Target <25cmH~2~O. flow-volume loop to minimise dynamic hyperiflation	


Pharmacological:

* **Bronchodilators**\
Many patients have a small response, and this assists in sputum clearance.
	* Ipratropium 500ug Q2H\
	Anticholinergic agents have a greater effect compared to beta-agonists.	
	* Salbutamol 5mg Q2H	
* **Steroids**\
Prednisolone 0.5mg/kg (or equivalent) for 5 days.
* **Antibiotics**\
Amoxycillin usually first line for *S. pneumoniae* and *H. influenzae* cover.
* Electrolyte correction
* DVT prophylaxis		


### Anaesthetic Considerations

* B
	* Smoking cessation  
	Patients are more receptive to smoking cessation perioperatively, and this should be encouraged.
	* Disease severity
		* Exercise tolerance
		* Number of exacerbations
		* Most recent course of antibiotics or steroids
		* Previous requirement for NIV or intubation
	* Wheezing  
	If present needs aggressive treatment with bronchodilators +/- steroids.
	* Active respiratory infection  
	Consider treatment and postponing surgery.
	* Consider CXR if:
		* Current infection
		* Recent deterioration in symptoms
	* Ventilator settings  
	Aim to minimise gas trapping:
		* ↑ the I:E ratio to prolong expiratory time  
		Suggest 1:3-1:5.
			* May require ↑ inspiratory flow rate and higher Pip
		* Consider PEEP  
		Aim to splint open small airways, and if ePEEP < iPEEP then worsening of CV effects will not occur.
		* Bronchospasm

* C
	* Pulmonary hypertension
	* Concomitant IHD
* D
	* General anaesthesia  
	↑ risk, particularly with intubation and IPPV, of:
		* Laryngospasm
		* Bronchospasm
		* Barotrauma
		* Hypoxaemia
		* Cardiovascular instability
	* Regional anaesthesia
* E
	* Neuromuscular blockade  
		* Ensure complete reversal prior to extubation
		* Consider extubation directly onto NIV  
		Reduces need for post-operative reintubation.

### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

## Complications

* Death:
	* 8% in-hospital mortality
	* 15% 90-day mortality
	* Up to 50% 1-year mortality

## Prognosis

Lung cancer is frequently seen and is the major cause of death.
