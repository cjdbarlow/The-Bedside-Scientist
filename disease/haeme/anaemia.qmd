# Anaemia Overview {#sec-anaemia}

Pathological ↓ in the haemoglobin concentration of blood, resulting in a ↓ oxygen carrying capacity, and is:

* Defined as a (sea-level) haemoglobin of:
	* ⩽130g/dL in men
	* ⩽120g/dL in non-pregnant women
	* ⩽110g/dL in pregnant women
* Classified by MCV into
	* Microcytic\
	MCV⩽ 80fL. Major causes are:
		* Iron deficiency
		* Congenital haemoglobinopathies
	* Normocytic\
	MCV 80-96fL. Major causes are:
		* Anaemia of chronic disease
		* Pregnancy
		* Haemolysis
		* Sickle-cell
	* Macrocytic\
	MCV ⩾96 fL. Major causes are:
		* Folate/Vitamin B~12~ deficiency
		* Alcohol
		* Drug effect


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Anaemia in preoperative patients in Australia is:

* Common
	* 6% of females
	* 2% of males
	* Risk ↑ with age\
	16% of patients over 75.
* Usually due to iron deficiency


## Pathophysiology

Anaemia of inflammation occurs due to:

* ↑ Erythrocyte phagocytosis\
Activated macrophages remove more red cells from circulation.
* ↓ Erythropoiesis\
Cytokines inhibit erythropoiesis, and may ↓ EPO expression.
* ↓ Iron availability\
Inflammation stimulates **hepcidin** release, which promotes iron trapping in marrow and erythrocytes.

## Clinical Features

Haemolysis:

* Infection
	* Viral haemorrhagic fever
	* Malaria
* Extracorporeal circuit


## Assessment

**History**:

* Fevers
* Travel

**Exam**:

* Jaundice
* Haemoglobinuria

### Investigations

**Bedside**:

**Laboratory**:

:::column-margin
Red cell abnormalities and iron studies are covered in more detail under @sec-rbc and @sec-iron.
:::

* Blood
	* FBE
		* Hb
		* MCV
		* MCHC
		* RCC
	* Blood film
		* Haemolysis
		* Sickle cells
	* CRP\
	Performed if ferritin is raised in a microcytic anaemia, to exclude reactive causes.
	* Iron studies
		* Ferritin\
		Assesses degree of iron deficiency.
			* Only reliable in absence of acute inflammation\
			Ferritin is an acute phase reactant
			* Normal range will depend on lab assay, but in general:
				* Severe: ⩽30μg/mL
				* Moderate: 30-50μg/mL
				* Mild: 50-100μg/mL
		* Transferrin saturation
			* <20% suggestive of iron deficiency
			* Useful in moderate ferritin deficiency
	* Bilirubin
	* Haemolysis screen
	* Coagulation screen
* Stool
	* Faecal occult blood test

### Diagnostic Approach and DDx


## Management

**Resuscitation**:

**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
	* **Iron supplementation**\
	If iron deficient.
		* **Oral**
			* Common
			* Cheap
			* Significantly limited by:
				* Time\
				May take ⩾3 months of therapy to be effective, and 6-9 months for equivalent effect of one IV replacement.
				* Absorption\
				Highly variable.
				* Intake
				* Non-compliance\
				Significant GI side effects.
			* 80mg elemental iron given every **second day**\
			Daily administration down-regulates hepcidin, and reduces absorption.
		* **IV**\
		Generally used if ferritin deficiency is severe, or moderate with low transferrin saturation.
			* Facilitate rapid repletion of stores
			* Requires local pathway to facilitate
			* Newer preparations have much lower incidence of anaphylaxis\
			Include iron polymaltose and iron carboxymaltose.
	* EPO\
	For renal anaemia without nutritional deficiency; generally requires nephrologist consultation.
	* Blood transfusion
* Procedural
* Physical

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:

**Preventative**:


### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

## Anaesthetic Considerations

Patients should be assessed **4-6 weeks pre-operatively**.

## Complications

## Prognosis

Anaemia is an independent risk factor for:

* Mortality
* Morbidity
* Hospitalisation
* ↓ Quality of Life
