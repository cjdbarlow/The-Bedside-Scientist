# von Willebrand Disease


von Willebrand Disease is a family of bleeding disorders caused by abnormal von Willebrand factor, a large glycoprotein that:

* Acts as the **carrier protein** for **factor VIII**
* Is required for **platelet adhesion**  
Provides an adhesive bridge from platelet to damaged subendothelium.


vWD is subdivided into:

* **Congenital**  
Divided into **three** subtypes:
	* **Type 1**  
	Quantitative reduction in normal vWF.
		* Mild clinical symptoms
		* Usually autosomal dominant
		* ~75% of patients
	* **Type 2**  
	Primarily **qualitative** defect.
		* 4 subtypes with varying degrees of severity
		* Autosomal dominant or recessive
	* **Type 3**  
	Absence of vWF.
		* Severe clinical bleeding
		* Autosomal recessive
* **Acquired**  
May be:
	* Malignant 
		* Lymphoproliferative disease
		* Myeloproliferative neoplasms
		* Wilms tumour
		* Carcinomas
	* Immune
		* SLE
	* Vascular flow  
	Shear stress on vWF multimers increases susceptibility to cleavage by ADAMTS13.
		* AS
		* LVAD/ECMO
		* MV prolapse
		* Congenital heart disease
		* Toxins
			* Valproic acid
			* Ciprofloxacin
		* Other
			* Hypothyroidism


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Most common hereditary bleeding disorder:

* Prevalence is ~1% worldwide  
However, only ~1% of these patients will display symptoms.

## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

## Clinical Manifestations

Bleeding:

* Mucocutaneous bleeding most common  
	* Dental procedures
* Minor surgery
	* Circumcision
* Menorrhagia
* PPH  
Usually secondary.

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

> Majority of patients will have normal FBE and coagulation studies

* FBE
	* Thrombocytopaenia  
	Mild may be seen in type 2B.
* Coags
	* Prolonged APTT  
	Abnormality depends on degree of factor VIII deficiency.
* Specialised testing  
Specified tests exist to evaluate presence of vWF antigen, factor VIII activity, and classify subtypes.


## Management

> * Approach depends on the type of vWF
> * If type is unknown, then treatment should begin empirically with vWF concentrate


Principles of management include:

* Clot stabilisation  
	* Antifibrinolytics (TXA)  
	Effective independent of aetiology of defect.
* Replenish vWF and FVIII levels
	* Increase native secretion
		* DDAVP
			* Causes release of vWF from endothelial storage sites  
			Therefore **effective in type 1**, occasionally in type 2, and never in type 3.
			* Give 0.3μg/kg, up to 20μg
			* Response is variable between patients, but usually consistent for the one patient
			* Tachyphylaxis occurs after 3-5 days
	* Exogenous factor replacement
		* vWF/FVIII concentrates
* Platelet transfusions


Management of refractory bleeding:

* Consider FVIIa
* Consider IVIG  
May be effective if due to anti-vWF autoantibodies, particularly if immune-acquired disease.
