# Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation

Acquired syndrome characterised by extreme systemic intravascular activation of coagulation that:

* Occurs secondary to an underlying condition
* Leads to:
	* High consumption of platelets and coagulation factors\
	Leading to coagulopathy and bleeding.
	* Microvascular fibrin thrombi\
	Leading to tissue ischaemia and multiorgan dysfunction.
* May be acute or chronic
	* Acute DIC is:
		* Generally more familiar
		* Characterised by microvascular thrombosis and bleeding
	* Chronic DIC is:
		* Associated with disease where thrombin formation is occurring over a prolonged period\
		e.g. Malignancy, IUFD, aneurysms, wound healing.
		* Partially compensated\
		Upregulation of:
			* Platelet and factor production\
			Assays may be normal or only slightly abnormal.
			* Hepatic FDP clearance
		* Characterised by thrombosis without bleeding

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Conditions which lead to the development of DIC include:

* Septic shock\
Occurs in ~35% of cases of severe sepsis.
* Trauma
	* Exsanguination
	* Burns
* Obstetrics
	* Abruptio placentae 
	* Haemorrhage
	* AFE
* Vascular malformations
* Malignancy
	* Solid organ tumours\
	Primarily thrombosis.
	* Acute promyelocytic leukaemia


## Pathophysiology

Normal coagulation involves:

* Vascular constriction
	* ↓ Bleeding
	* Provides time for haemostasis
* Platelet plugging
* Fibrin clot formation
	* Coagulation cascade initiated predominantly via the extrinsic pathway by exposed tissue factor


Underlying disease profoundly stimulates procoagulant activity, resulting in:

* Excessive thrombin generation
* Thrombin overcomes anticoagulant control mechanisms\
Namely:
	* Protein C
	* Antithrombin
	* Tissue factor pathway inhibitor
* Thrombosis occurring throughout the vasculature

### Aetiology

## Assessment

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

DIC scoring system:

* Underlying disorder associated with DIC?\
Required.
* Coagulation results:
	* Platelet count
		* ⩾100: 0
		* 50-100: 1
		* ⩽50: 
	* FDPs
		* No ↑: 0
		* Moderate ↑: 2
		* Strong ↑: 3
	* PT
		* ⩽3s: 0
		* 3-6s: 1
		* ⩾6s 2
	* Fibrinogen level:
		* ⩾1: 0
		* ⩽1: 1
* Interpretation\
Score of >5 compatible with acute DIC.




## Investigations

:::info
Laboratory investigations:

* Are not accurate to provide diagnosis on their own
* Can be used to score likelihood for DIC
:::

**Laboratory**:

* Blood:
	* FBE
		* Anaemia\
		Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia.
		* Thrombocytopaenia\
		Low or rapidly ↓
	.* Coagulation
		* Assays (PT, APTT)\
		Prolonged, but this may be minimal.
		* Fibrinogen\
		May be either reduced or ↑.
			* Reduced to consumption
			* ↑ due to role as acute phase reactant
	* Fibrin Degradation Products (e.g. D-dimer)\
	↑ Due to fibrinolysis.
	* Blood film\
	Schistocyte formation.



## Management

Treat the underlying condition.

Management then depends on predominant clinical picture:

* Active bleeding\
Transfuse to keep:
	* Platelets >30-50
	* PT <3s
	* Fibrinogen >1.5
	* Consider vitamin K
	* Consider antifibrinolytic
* No major bleeding or thrombosis\
Prophylactic LMWH.
* Overt thromboembolism or organ failure\
	* Therapeutic anticoagulation\
	Usually UFH.


### Anaesthetic Considerations

### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

## Complications

Include:

* Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia
* Organ failures
	* 15% of malignancy
	* 40% of sepsis

## Prognosis

Strong independent predictor of mortality in critically ill patients.
