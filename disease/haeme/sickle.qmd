# Sickle Cell Disease {#sec-hbs}

Congenital haemoglobinopathy leading to production of the **relatively insoluble haemoglobin S**, causing erythrocytes to adopt a 'sickle' shape under conditions of physiologic stress. Sickle cell anaemia leads to:

* Vaso-occlusion and haemolysis
	* Pain due to microvascular obstruction
	* Progressive multiorgan dysfunction due to ischaemia
* Relative protection against malaria\
Sickled cells haemolyse prematurely, interrupting the *Plasmodium* life-cycle.


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

Autosomal recessive:

* Homozyogotes have **sickle cell disease**
	* Chronic haemolytic anaemia
	* Recurrent vaso-occlusion and severe pain
	* Progressive organ damage
	* Often early death
* Heterozygotes have **sickle cell trait**
	* Results in HbS levels of ~30-40%
	* HbS may precipitate in conditions of physiologic stress
	* Usually well


HbS:

* Work normally when oxygenated
* Deforms in hypoxia, resulting in polymerisation and deformation of the red cell into a sickle shape\
Sickled cells:
	* Are rigid and sticky\
	Can obstruct capillary flow, leading to vaso-occlusion.
	* Haemolyse rapidly\
	Lifespan of 10-20 days
		* Leads to anaemia due to rapid turnover


### Aetiology

## Clinical Manifestations

:::info
Sickle cell anaemia may present as a series of different crises.
:::

**Vasoocclusive crisis**:

* Sudden onset pain\
Ischaemia or infarction secondary to microvascular obstruction.
* Hypovolaemia\
Inability to concentrate urine.
	* Generally hypernatraemic, and require volume resuscitation with hypotonic solutions


**Sequestration crisis**:

* Pooling of erythrocytes in spleen and liver\
Presents as:
	* Anaemia
	* Hypovolaemic shock

## Assessment

**History**:

**Exam**:

### Investigations

**Bedside**:

**Laboratory**:

* Blood
	* FBE
		* Chronic anaemia
	* Hb electrophoresis\
	For diagnosis.
	* Blood film:
		* Sickle forms
		* Reticulocytosis
	* Sickledex test:
		* Rapid screening
		* Qualitative detection of HbS levels >10%

### Diagnostic Approach and DDx




## Management

:::priority
* Prevent and treat sickling **precipitants**
* **Transfusion**
:::

**Resuscitation**:

**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
	* Vaccination\
	If asplenic.
* Procedural
	* Bone marrow transplantation\
	Usually restricted to <16 year olds.
	* Exchange transfusion\
	May be required for severe vasoocclusive crises.
* Physical

:::column-margin
Asplenism is covered under @sec-asplenia.
:::

**Supportive care**:

* H
	* Hb >50

**Disposition**:

**Other**:


**Prevention**:

* Avoid **precipitants**
	* Dehydration
		* Exercise
		* Hot weather
		* Alcohol
	* Hypoxia
		* Smoking
		* OSA
	* Physiological stress
	* Hypothermia
* Folic acid supplementation
* Hydroxyurea\
â†‘ HbF formation, and so reduces frequency and severity of vaso-occlusive crises.




### Medical

### Surgical

### Anaesthetic Considerations

:::caution
Avoid precipitants of vaso-occlusive crises:

* Hypoxia
* Acidosis
* Hypercapnoea
:::

* B
	* PHTN
* C
	* CCF
	* Volume state
		* Minimise fasting period
		* Preoperative hydration
	* Avoid venous stasis
* E
	* Tourniquet use
		* May precipitate sickle crisis distal to tourniquet\
		* Careful exsanguination of distal limb prior to inflation
* H
	* Sickle cell severity
		* Frequency of exacerbations
	* Hb
		* Should be transfused to Hb >100g/dL or HbS <30%



### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

## Complications

* B
	* Pulmonary hypertension\
	Recurrent pulmonary infarction.
* C
	* Cardiac failure
* D
	* TIAs/CVAs
* H
	* Functional asplenism\
	Consequential lymphoid hypertrophy.
