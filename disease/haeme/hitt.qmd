# Heparin Induced Thrombocytopaenia

Immune-mediated **hypercoagulable state** due to **formation** of **auto-antibodies** to a **heparin-platelet** complex that is divided into **two types**:

* **Type I**\
Not clinically significant, characterised by:
	* Transient drop in platelet count
	* No thrombosis
	* Occurs in **first 2 days**
* **Type II**\
Clinically significant that may progress to HITT. Type II is:
	* More common
	* Presents **5-14 days after** heparin **exposure**\
	Leads to:
		* Thrombocytopenia\
			* Usually to 30-50% of baseline
			* Not <20×10^9^/L.
		* Thrombosis\
		May be arterial or venous, and in both large and small vessels.


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Incidence:

* 1:5000 of hospitalised patients \


Risk factors:

* Critically ill\
0.3-09.5%.
* Surgery
* Cardiac surgery\
1-3%.
* UFH > LMWH
* Female


## Pathophysiology

* Platelet factor 4 protein is expressed on platelet cell surface
* This binds heparin and activates lymphocytes and antibodies
* Production of an IgG antibody to this factor results in platelet activation


## Clinical Features

Key factors:

* Appropriate timing
* Thrombocytopenia\
Either <150 x10^9^/L or ↓ by >50%.
* Thrombosis

## Investigations

Laboratory:

* Blood
	* FBE
		* Thrombocytopenia
	* Antibody screening
		* Sensitive but non-specific
		* High false positive rate
	* Serotonin release assay
		* Limited to reference laboratories
		* Functional test evaluating immunologic response of platelets to heparin
		* Donor platelets pre-treated with C-serotonin are exposed to patient serum (or plasma nad heparin)
		* Serotonin release >20-50% (lab dependent) is positive

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

:::caution
Diagnosis is challenging due to multiple potential causes of thrombocytopaenia and common use of heparins.
:::

Risk may be calculated using the **4T score**:

* 0-3: Low probability
* 4-5: Intermediate probability
* 6-8: high probability

Differentials include:

* Thrombotic microangiopathy
* Drug-induced thrombocytopenia
* Venous thrombosis
* Hypersensitivity reactions


## Management

Cease heparin:

* UFH and LMWH
* Heparin flushes in arterial lines
* Heparin bonded:
	* Extracorporeal circuits
	* Lines
	* IDCs


Transition to a non-heparinoid anticoagulant:

* Direct thrombin-inhibitor
	* Bivalirudin\
	If impaired hepatic and renal function.
	* Argatroban\
	If normal hepatic function.
* Factor Xa inhibitor\
	* Fondaparinux\
	Useful for CVTI prophylaxis.
* Vitamin K antagonist\
Only when platelet count is >150 x10^9^/L due to risk of worsening thrombosis.
* DOAC


Platelet transfusion:

* If platelets <20 x10^9^/L


Consider plasmapheresis:

* If refractory to medical therapy
* If requiring heparin/protamine for CPB in patients with previous HITT

### Anaesthetic Considerations

### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

## Complications

Death:

* Up to 20%

## Prognosis

Recovery:

* Platelet count improves usually within ~1/52 after cessation of heparin\
May take weeks.
* Antibody clearance takes 50-85 days
* Future heparin exposure does not guarantee recurrence, but heparin exposure should be minimised in future
