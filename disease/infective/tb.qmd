# Tuberculosis



## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

## Clinical Manifestations

Systemic:

* Fever
* Sweating
* Weight loss
* Anorexia

Respiratory:

* Productive cough
* Dyspnoea
* Localised wheezing
* Apical crepitations
* Persistent pneumonias
* Spontaneous pneumothorax
* Pleural effusions

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

Radiology:

* CXR\
Very sensitive and a normal CXR almost excludes TB, except in:
    * HIV +ve patients
    * Early apical disease

 
Sputum:

* Exceedingly difficult to culture
* Multiple samples should be collected across different days
* Request:
    * Fluorescent microscopy for AFB
    * Culture

    
Bronchoscopy:

* BAL
* Bronchial biopsy\
May be indicated if high clinical suspicion and negative smear. 


## Management

**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological\
Combination of **4 antimicrobials** requried for treatment, divided into:
    * Initial phase\
    8 weeks of:
        * Rifampacin 450-600mg daily
        * Isoniazid 300mg
        * Pyrazinamide 1.5-2g daily
        * Ethambutol 15mg/kg daily\
        May cause visual disturbances; should be restricted to patients with reasonable acuity and ability to report disturbances.
    * Continuation phase
* Physical
    * Infection control measures
        * Treat as contagious if:
            * Active coughing
            * Positive AFB smear
            * <2 weeks of treatment (of non-resistant strains) 
        * Should be managed in negative-pressure isolation


### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

## Anaesthetic Considerations

## Complications

* Death
    * 25% in those requiring ICU
    * 50% in those requiring mechanical ventilation

## Prognosis

## Key Studies
