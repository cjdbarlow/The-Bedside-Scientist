# Community Acquired Pneumonia

Infection of pulmonary parenchyma in a patient who was not hospitalised prior to the onset of symptoms, with both:

:::column-margin
Systemic symptoms are much less common in the elderly and may be absent. Non-respiratory symptoms may also be present.
:::

* Symptoms of acute infection
* Evidence of pulmonary infiltrate
    * Radiographic
    * Clinical\
    Crepitations, etc.
     

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

CAP has an annual incidence of up to 4% of the population:

* 50% require hospital admission
    * Mortality 10% among the hospitalised group
* 10% require ICU admission


## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

There are vast numbers of potentially causative organisms, however the most common in patients requiring ICU admission are:

* Viral\
25%, most commonly:
    * RSV
    * Influenza
* ***S. Pneumoniae***
* *H. Influenzae*
* *Legionella* spp.
* *Enterobacteriaceae* spp.
* *S. aureus*
* *Psuedomonas* spp.


Factors favouring infection with certain organisms include:

* Exposures
    * Animal
        * Animal exposures
        * Birds and excreta
        * Parturient pets or farm animals
        * Insect bites
        * Mice and excreta
        * Bats and excreta
    * Geographical factors
        * TB prevalence
        * Locally endemic organisms
* Patient factors
    * IVDU
    * Alcoholism 
    * Respiratory disease
        * COPD
        * CF
        * Bronchiectasis
    * Other disease
        * Diabetes
        * Sickle cell
        * Poor dental hygeine
    * Immunosuppression  
* Disease factors
    * Sputum smell
    * Lung abscesses
    * Empyema


## Clinical Manifestations

May be either:

* Systemic
    * Fever
    * Sweats
    * Rigors
* Respiratory
    * Productive cough
    * Pleural rub
    * Inspiratory crepitations  


## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

Bloods:

* FBE
* UEC
* LFT
* Blood cultures (x2-3)
* HIV status


Sputum:

:::column-margin
Anaerobic culture cannot be performed on sputum due to contamination from other upper respiratory organisms.
:::

* Tests include:
    * Gram stain
    * Culture
    * *Mycoplasma pneumoniae* PCR
    * *Chlamydophilia* PCR
* Collection is ideally:
    * From a **deep cough**\
    To minimise contamination from upper respiratory tract commensals.
    * Prior to antibiotics
* Rapid transport to laboratory â†‘ chance of detecting fastidious organisms
* Causative organism is likely if:
    * Dominant on gram stain
    * Heavy growth on culture


Urine:

* Legionella antigen\
Highly specific but not sensitive for infection; negative test does not exclude disease.
* Pneumococcal antigen\
Highly specific and moderately sensitive.

Radiology:

* CXR\
Radiographic infiltrates may be absent in up to 25%.
* CT\
More sensitive than CXR.
* Lung ultrasound

## Management

:::info
Up to 40% of patients have a polymicrobial infection, so narrowing the spectrum of cover following identification of an organism may result in adequate treatment.
:::

**Resuscitation**:\

* A
* B
    * Supplemental oxygen

**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
     * Antimicrobial therapy
        * Often unit or region-specific based on local flora and resistance patterns
        * 7-10 day course recommended for moderate-severe disease
* Procedural
* Physical

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:

### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

* Corticosteroids\
Routine use not recommended, may be appropriate with concurrent sepsis.


## Complications

* Parapneumonic effusion
    * Uncomplicated effusions resolve with resolution of the underlying infection
    * Complex effusions:
        * Develop 1-2 weeks after the initial fluid collection
        * May occur with persistent fevers and have organisms on Gram stain\
        Essentially empyema-lite.
* Empyema\
Collection of pus in the pleural space, usually evolving from a parapneumonic effusion. Antibiotics are adjunctive, and these require drainage either:
    * Percutaneous\
    First-line therapy, but difficult to effectively drain extensively loculated collections.
    * Surgical\
    Open or VATS drainage is the most effetive tool.

## Prognosis

Time until improvement varies:

* Average ~3 days
* 7 days in the:
    * Elderly
    * Bacteraemic
* 2.5 days in young patients with pneumococcal pneumonia
