# Community Acquired Pneumonia

Infection of pulmonary parenchyma in a patient who was not hospitalised prior to the onset of symptoms, with both:

:::column-margin
Systemic symptoms are much less common in the elderly and may be absent.\
\
Non-respiratory symptoms may also be present.
:::

* Symptoms of acute infection
* Evidence of pulmonary infiltrate
    * Radiographic
    * Clinical\
    Crepitations, etc.
   \

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

CAP has an annual incidence of up to 4% of the population:

* 50% require hospital admission
    * Mortality 10% among the hospitalised group
* 10% require ICU admission


## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

There are vast numbers of potentially causative organisms, however the most common in patients requiring ICU admission are:

* Viral\
25%, most commonly:
    * RSV
    * Influenza
* ***S. Pneumoniae***
* *H. Influenzae*
* *Legionella* spp.
* *Enterobacteriaceae* spp.
* *S. aureus*
* *Psuedomonas* spp.


Factors favouring infection with certain organisms include:

* Exposures
    * Animal
        * Animal exposures
        * Birds and excreta
        * Parturient pets or farm animals
        * Insect bites
        * Mice and excreta
        * Bats and excreta
    * Geographical factors
        * TB prevalence
        * Locally endemic organisms
* Patient factors
    * IVDU
    * Alcoholism 
    * Respiratory disease
        * COPD
        * CF
        * Bronchiectasis
    * Other disease
        * Diabetes
        * Sickle cell
        * Poor dental hygeine
    * Immunosuppression\
* Disease factors
    * Sputum smell
    * Lung abscesses
    * Empyema


## Clinical Manifestations

May be either:

* Systemic
    * Fever
    * Sweats
    * Rigors
* Respiratory
    * Productive cough
    * Pleural rub
    * Inspiratory crepitations\


## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

Assessment of severity:

* Determines disposition (home, inpatient, intensive care)
* Can be performed with the SMART COP score
    * ⩾4 has 1/3 chance of requiring vasoactive or respiratory support
    * Consists of:
        * SBP <90
        * Multilobar infiltrate
        * Albumin <35g/L
        * RR:
            * \>30 if age >50
            * \>25 if age >25
        * Tachycardia >125
        * Confusion
        * Oxygen saturation <93%
        * pH <7.35

## Investigations

**Laboratory**:

* **Blood**:
    * FBE
    * UEC
    * LFT
    * Blood cultures (x2-3)
    * CRP\
    ↑ Benefit from steroids seen with ↑ CRP.
    * HIV status
* **Sputum**:
    * Tests include:
        * Gram stain
        * Culture
        * *Mycoplasma pneumoniae* PCR
        * *Chlamydophilia* PCR
    * Collection is ideally:
        * From a **deep cough**\
        To minimise contamination from upper respiratory tract commensals.
        * Prior to antibiotics
    * Rapid transport to laboratory ↑ chance of detecting fastidious organisms
    * Causative organism is likely if:
        * Dominant on gram stain
        * Heavy growth on culture
* **Urine**:
    * Legionella antigen\
    Highly specific but not sensitive for infection; negative test does not exclude disease.
    * Pneumococcal antigen\
    Highly specific and moderately sensitive.

:::column-margin
Anaerobic culture cannot be performed on sputum due to contamination from other upper respiratory organisms.
:::


**Imaging**:

* CXR\
Radiographic infiltrates may be absent in up to 25%.
* CT\
More sensitive than CXR.
* Lung ultrasound

## Management

:::info
Up to 40% of patients have a polymicrobial infection, so narrowing the spectrum of cover following identification of an organism may result in adequate treatment.
:::

**Resuscitation**:\

* A
* B
    * Supplemental oxygen

**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
    * **Antimicrobial therapy**
        * Non-tropical
            * Mild:\
            5-7 days of:
                * Amoxicillin 1g PO TDS
                * Clarithromycin 250mg PO BD
            * Moderate:\
            7-10 days of:
                * Benzylpenicillin 1.2g IV QID and doxycycline 100mg PO BD
                * Ceftriaxone 1g IV daily and doxycycline 100mg PO BD
            * Severe:\
            7-10 days of:
                * Benzylpenicillin 1.2g IV Q4H and gentamicin
                * Ceftriaxone 1g IV daily and azithromycin 500mg IV daily
        * Tropical\
        To cover *Burkholderia pseudomallei* and *Acinetobacter baumannii*:
            * Meropenem 1g IV TDS and azithromycin 500mg IV daily
    * **Hydrocortisone**
        * Possible mortality benefit
        * Suggest 200mg/day
        * Unless contraindicated
            * Chronic infection
            * Immunocompromised
            * Poorly controlled diabetes
            * Pregnancy
* Procedural
* Physical

:::column-margin
Antimicrobial therapy is often unit or region-specific based on local flora and resistance patterns.
:::

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:

* ICU or HDU for severe disease

### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

* Corticosteroids\
Routine use not recommended, may be appropriate with concurrent sepsis.


## Complications

* Parapneumonic effusion
    * Uncomplicated effusions resolve with resolution of the underlying infection
    * Complex effusions:
        * Develop 1-2 weeks after the initial fluid collection
        * May occur with persistent fevers and have organisms on Gram stain\
        Essentially empyema-lite.
* Empyema\
Collection of pus in the pleural space, usually evolving from a parapneumonic effusion. Antibiotics are adjunctive, and these require drainage either:
    * Percutaneous\
    First-line therapy, but difficult to effectively drain extensively loculated collections.
    * Surgical\
    Open or VATS drainage is the most effetive tool.

## Prognosis

Time until improvement varies:

* Average ~3 days
* 7 days in the:
    * Elderly
    * Bacteraemic
* 2.5 days in young patients with pneumococcal pneumonia 


## Key Studies

* [CAPE COD](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2215145)
    * 800 French ICU patients with severe CAP
        * Without septic shock
        * Without features suggesting other causes of pneumonia mimics
    * 200mg hydrocortisone infusion vs. placebo
    * Significant:
        * ↓ Mortality in treatment group (6.2% vs. 11.9%)
        * ↑ Insulin use in treatment group
    * Stopped early due to COVID and significance on interim analysis
