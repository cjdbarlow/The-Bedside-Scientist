# COVID-19

:::info
Also known as coronavirus disease 2019, COVID, and SARS-CoV-2.
:::

COVID-19 is a respiratory viral disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 beta-coronavirus that:

* Has an **incubation** period of **4-5 days**
* Becomes **symptomatic** between **2-7 days**\
In the majority (75%) of cases; and rarely after 14 days.
* May spread from asymptomatic patients\
Up to 50%.
* Has a **broad spectrum** of clinical presentation:
	* **Mild URTI** symptoms **in ~80%** for ~7 days\
	* **Respiratory failure** requiring hospital admission **in ~15%**\
	Generally between day 5-10.
	* Severe pneumonitis and **ARDS or multiorgan failure in ~5%**


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Pandemic:

* Disease first identified in Wuhan City, Hubei in November 2019
* Global emergency declared 30 January 2020
* Global pandemic declared 11 March 2020


Transmission:

* Person-to-person
* Via respiratory droplets, contact, and possible aerosols
	* Droplets may persist for up to 4 days

![Viability of COVID-19 Aerosols on Different Surfaces](/resources/cov2_decay.jpg)

## Pathophysiology

Viral characteristics:

* Cellular entry effected via trans-membrane glycoproteins ("spike") proteins
	* Bind to surface ACE2 receptors\
	Found on:
		* Pneumocytes
		* Respiratory tract epithelium
		* Small bowel enterocyte
* Hypoxaemia with normal lung compliance
* Diffuse alveolar damage

:::column-margin
Coronaviruses are named due to their characteristic halo under electron microscopy, and include:

* Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\
SARS-CoV, in 2002.
* Middle East Respiratory Syndrome\
MERS-CoV, in 2012.
:::

Staging:

1. Early Infection
	* Non-specific clinical features

2. Pulmonary phase
	* Dyspnoea and hypoxaemic respiratory failure
	* Abnormal chest imaging
3. Hyper-inflammation phase

	* ↑ Inflammatory markers


## Clinical Features

Features are non-specific, and include:

* Fever\
80-90%; typically high and persistent.

### History


### Exam


### Investigations

**Bedside**:

* Rapid antigen testing

**Laboratory**:

* Blood
	* FBE
		* Leukopaenia or leukocytosis may occur\
		Typically ↑ WCC in critically unwell.
		* Lymphopaenia
		* Thrombocytopaenia
	* LFT\
	Monitor when using immunosuppressive agents, and consider ceasing if ↑ transaminases.
	* ↑ LDH
	* Coagulation studies
		* DIC
	* Antibody testing\
	IgM or IgG antibodies:
		* Require up to 14 days to become positive
		* Detect presence of recent infection
	* Inflammatory markers\
	Typically correlate with severity. Include:
		* CRP\
		Rate of rise correlates with degree of inflammation and is a marker of future clinical deterioration.
		* Procalcitonin
		* IL-6
* Respiratory sample
	* PCR
		* Sensitivity 60-95%\
		Varies depending on quality of sample and amount of viral shedding.

:::column-margin
Bronchoalveolar lavage is more sensitive, but is aerosol generating.
:::

**Imaging**:

:::column-margin
Radiological changes develop between 2-5 days, and become maximal at day 13-15.
:::

* CXR
	* Bilateral alveolar opacities most common
	* Pleural effusions are uncommon
* CT chest\
	* Routine CT is not required
	* Typical appearance includes:
		* Peripheral, bilateral ground glass opacities
		* Multifocal ground glass opacities
		* Organising pneumonia in late disease
	* Non-specific features include:
		* Multifocal, diffuse, or unilateral ground glass opacitie
	* Indicating for investigating:
		* PE
		* Non-resolving disease for investigation of persistent pneumonic causes


**Other**:

### Diagnostic Approach and DDx

Diagnostic criteria change overtime, however:

* **Confirmed case**\
Positive:
	* NAA
	* Viral culture
* **Probable case**\
All of:
	* Not tested
	* Febrile (>38°C) or symptomatic
	* Household contact of confirmed or probable case
* **Suspected case**\
Meets both clinical and epidemiological criteria:
	* Clinical\
	Febrile or symptomatic.
	* Epidemiological\
	Significant risk factor in the last 14 days:
		* Close contact with confirmed or probable case
		* Travel
		* Cruise ship exposure
		* Healthcare exposure
		* High-risk community exposure


## Management

:::priority
* **Airborne precautions**
* Use appropriate **PPE**
* Manage **hypoxaemia**
	* **Prone** positioning
	* **Non-invasive** ventilation is preferred to invasive ventilation where possible
	* **Invasive ventilation** should use a **lung protective** strategy
* **Immunosuppression**\
Choice varies depending on disease severity.

: Immunosuppression for COVID-19 by Disease Severity

+----------+-----------------------------+
| Severity | Immunosuppression Used      |
+==========+=============================+
| Mild     | * Remdesivir                |
+----------+-----------------------------+
| Moderate | * Dexamethasone             |
|          | * Baricitinib               |
+----------+-----------------------------+
| Severe   | * Dexamethaxone             |
|          | * Tocilizumab\              |
|          | If no baricitinib received. |

**Resuscitation**:

* A
	* **Intubation**\
	Consider:
		* Aerosoliation
		* Rapid hypoxaemia on induction
		* Hypotension post-induction
			* Hypovolaemia
			* Effect of high PEEP
* B
	* **Correct hypoxaemia** to SpO~2~ 92-96%
		* High flow nasal oxygen
			* Titrate FiO~2~ to SpO~2~
			* Titrate flow to work of breathing
			* Minimal effect on recruitment\
			Combine with proning to minimise atelectasis.
		* NIV\
			* CPAP up to 15cmH~2~O
			* Assists recruitment and may be more beneficial in early disease
			* Significantly ↓ Rate of intubation
		* Invasive ventilation
		* Permissive hypercapnoea
	* **Proning**


**Specific therapy**:

:::column-margin
![Remdesivir Efficacy by Disease Severity](/resources/covid_remdes.jpg)
:::

* Pharmacological
	* **Remdesivir** 200mg IV load, then 100mg IV OD for a total of 5 days
		* Paediatric dosing: 5mg/kg load, then 2.5mg/kg on subsequent days
		* Indicated only for mild and moderate disease, within 7 days of symptom onset\
		Limited utility in the hospital population.
		* ↓ Time to clinical recovery in mild cases
		* Contraindicated with:
			* Renal failure
			* Multi-organ failure
			* Neutropenia
	* **Dexamethasone** 6mg IV/PO daily for at least 10 days
		* Indicated for severe or critical disease
		* Methylprednisolone 32mg/day or prednisolone 40mg/day may be used if dexamethasone is unavailable
		* Consider ↑ to 12-20mg/day if tocilizumab or baricitinib are not available or are contraindicated
		* Significant ↓ in absolute mortality
	* **Baricitinib** 4mg PO daily for up to 14 days, or until hospital discharge
		* Janus kinase inhibitor, ↓ downstream effects of IL-6
		* Significant ↓ mortality in severe disease
		* Use 2mg PO daily if eGFR <30mL/min
		* Contraindicated in:
			* ESRD
			* Acute severe infection
			* Severe immune dysfunction
			* Neutropenia
			* Pregnancy
	* **Tocilizumab** 8mg/kg single dose
		* Indicated for patients requiring intubation and who have not received baricitinib
		* ↓ Mortality in combination with dexamethasone
		* Sarilumab may be used if tocilizumab is unavailable
* Procedural
	* VV ECMO
* Physical
	* **Proning**\
	For all patients requiring more than low-flow oxygen support.
		* Can be performed awake
		* Side-to-side positioning for patients unwilling or unable to lie prone

:::column-margin
Tocilizumab is indicated only for patients with evidence of systemic inflammation, defined as a CRP >75mg/L.
:::

**Supportive care**:

* D
	* RASS 0 to -2 in the intubated patient
* F
	* Conservative fluid management
	* Avoid hypervolaemia
* H
	* Thromboprophylaxis\
	For all patients with moderate or worse disease.

**Disposition**:

**Preventative**:

* Vaccination


### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

The following are not recommended:

* Convalescent plasma\
Primary driver of severe disease is inflammation, not viral load.
* Hydroxychloroquine
* Famotidine
* Ivermectin
* Fluvoxamine
* Colchicine

## Anaesthetic Considerations

## Complications

* Death\
Mortality is highly age dependent:
    * <10: 0.002%
    * 10-25: 0.01%
    * 25-55: 0.4%
    * 55-65: 1.4%
    * 65-75: 4.6%
    * 75-85: 15%, 
    * \>90: >25%
* B
	* Pulmonary fibrosis
	* Bacterial coinfection\
	Uncommon outside of the intubated patient.
* C
	* Myocarditis\
	Up to 33% of critically ill patients.
	* Cardiomyopathy
* F
	* AKI\
	Multifactorial:
		* Diuresis
		* Renal microthrombi
* H
	* Venous thromboembolism
* I
	* Cytokine storm\
	Similar to HLH.
