# Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome

HIV is a retrovirus that infects immune cells, leading to:

* An initial, non-specific viral infection\
Termed seroconversion illness.
* Chronic immunodeficiency\
Termed AIDS.

:::column-margin
When it was first identified, HIV was named HTLV-3 (Human T-lymphotropic Virus), and the more common (and pathogenic) variant named HIV-1 after the rarer and less virulent HIV-2 was discovered in West Africa.

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

Viral exposure results in:

* Initial infection of cell surface receptor\
Classically CD4, though other receptors are implicated as co-receptors.
	* Viral RNA is integrated into cellular DNA
	* RNA transcribed from cellular RNA, and translated into viral protein
* Initial viraemia presents as seroconversion illness, and is typically controlled by initial immune response
* HIV replication continues in a largely asymptomatic fashion
* Progressive immune deficiency occurs despite persistent host immune response, with ↓ in CD4+ T cells\
Rate varies depending on host and viral factors:
	* Median ~9 years
	* Some show no evidence of CD4 loss for up to 15 years

### Aetiology

## Clinical Manifestations

Seroconversion illness occurs 1-4 weeks following exposure:

* Fever
* Lymphadenopathy
* Headache
* Photophobia
* Fatigue


Chronic infection may cause:

* Fever
* Weight loss
* Lymphadenopathy
* Diarrhoea


## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

**Bedside**:

**Laboratory**:

* Bloods
	* Diagnosis
		* anti-HIV antibodies\
		Diagnostic of infection; positive in most patients within 3 months of infection.
	* Monitoring\
	3-4 monthly testing in stable patients.
		* HIV viral load
		* CD4+ count
			* Best indicator of severity of immunodeficiency and susceptibility to infection
			* AIDS-related illnesses unlikely if >200

**Laboratory**:

**Other**:

## Management

**Resuscitation**:

ABC approach. Comment on team coordination and clinical priorities.

**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
	* Antiretroviral therapy\
	Each drug acts at different points in the replication cycle, and so combination therapy is essential.
		* Triple combination therapy usually leads to sustained control without resistance development
		* Initiation by HIV specialist
		* Potential significant drug interactions
		* Timing of therapy in the setting of infection is controversial\
		In general:
			* Delay initiation until 2-4 weeks after treatment of aids defining illness\
			Longer in more severe disease with ↑ risk of @sec-iris.
* Procedural
* Physical

:::column-margin
Significant drug interactions may occur with:

* Anaesthetics
	* Midazolam
* Antimicrobials
* Antiemetics
* Anticonvulsants
* Anticoagulants
* Statins
:::

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:

**Preventative**:


### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

## Anaesthetic Considerations

## Complications

Divided into:

:::column-margin
Pulmonary infections are more common at higher CD4 counts, extra-pulmonary infection becomes more common as CD4 counts fall.
:::

* **Direct** complications of immune deficiency
	* **Infections**
		* Immunocompromised\
			* **PJP**
			* Oesophageal candidiasis\
			Common presenting disease.
			* **Cryptococcal meningitis**\
			Non-specific and not-particularly-meningitic presentation:
				* Headache
				* Fevers
				* Minimal neck stiffness\
				Relies on inflammation of the meninges, which in turn relies on a functioning immune response.
			* *Mycobacterium avium* complex
			* CMV retinitis
			* **TB**
			* Cerebral toxoplasmosis
				* Focal encephalitis
				* Requires brain biopsy for diagnosis
		* Generic
			* Sepsis
			* Pneumonia
	* **Tumours**
		* Immunocompromised
			* T-cell **lymphoma**\
			Particularly CNS lymphomas.
			* Karposi Sarcoma\
			Angioproliferative tumour of epithelium relating to herpes virus 8 infection, which presents as red-purple lesions on skin and oral and gastric mucosa.
	* Immune reconstitution syndrome
* Indirect complications
	* C
		* Autoimmune vasculitis
		* Dilated cardiomyopathy
		* CAD
	* D
		* Autonomic neuropathy
	* Drug-related
		* Type B lactic acidosis
		* Pancreatitis
		* AKI
		* Stevens-Johnson syndrome

## Prognosis

The natural history of HIV is a general decline in immune function with an ↑ burden of exotic and severe disease:

With access to antiretroviral therapy, mortality approaches that of the general population.
