# Non-Responding Pneumonia {#sec-pers_pneumonia}

Failure to improve after an arbitrary 5 days of treatment should prompt a search for causes and appropriate treatment.


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

* Age
* Comorbidities
    * Chronic respiratory disease
    * Lifestyle
        * Hight alcohol intake
        * Smoking
* Pneumonia
    * Multilobar
    * Bacteraemia
    * Infected collections
    * Organisms
        * Legionella
        * Polymicrobial
