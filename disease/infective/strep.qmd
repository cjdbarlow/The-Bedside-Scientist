# Streptococci

Ovoid gram positive organisms that come in pairs (diplococci) or chains, and are subdivided into:

* **α-Haemolytic**\
Produce **green rings** around colonies on agar. Includes:
	* *S. pneumoniae*
	* *S. bovis*
	* *S. mutans*
* **β-Hemolytic**\
Cause lysis of cells, resulting in **clear rings** around colonies, and further divided by the **Lancefield scheme**. Includes:
	* Group A: *S. pyogenes*
	* Group B: *S agalactiae*
* **γ-Haemolytic**\
No change around colonies. Includes (note can be also α-haemolytic):
	* *S. bovis*
	* *S. mutans*
* **Enterococci**

## α-Haemolytic

*S. pneumoniae* is an obligate parasite and normal nasopharyngeal commensal. Infection:

* Also known as pneumococcal infection
* Requires some ↑ susceptibility:
	* Extremes of age
	* Recent viral pneumonia\
	With streptococcal bacterial superinfection.
	* Immunosuppression
		* Smokers
		* Asplenic
			* Splenectomy
			* Sickle-cell disease
		* Malnutrition
		* Alcoholism
* Include:
	* **Meningitis**\
	Most common cause in *H. influenzae* vaccinated individuals.
	* **CAP**\
	Most common cause.
	* Otitis media
	* Sinusitis
	* Mastoiditis



## Lancefield Scheme

Divides β-haemolytic streptococci into several groups based on cell wall composition.

### Group A

**Group A** is synonymous with ***S. Pyogenes***:

* **Reservoir in** skin and mucous membranes of **humans**\
**Spread by contact** from person to person. 
* Produces hyaluronidase which destroys connective tissue
* Cell walls contain an M protein which:
	* Is essential for infection
	* Has a high number of antigenic types\
	Repeat infection is possible and common.
	* Antibodies to M protein are common precipitants of **rheumatic fever**\
	Preventable if antimicrobials provided within **10 days**.


Infections include:

* B
	* Pharyngitis\
	Purulent inflammation of tonsils and oropharynx. Labeled scarlet fever if it occurs with endotoxin production.
* I
	* Minor skin infections
		* Erysipelas
		* Impetigo
	* **Necrotising fasciitis**


Complications include:

* **Toxic shock syndrome**
* Rheumatic fever
* Acute glomerulonephritis


### Group B

Group B is synonymous with *S. Agalactiae*:

* Carried in urogenital and GI tract
	* Transmitted sexually or at birth


Infections include:

* Neonatal\
Risk ↓, but not eliminated by, caesarian section. Intrapartum antibiotics given if high risk features.
	* Meningitis
	* Septicaemia
* Endometritis
* Opportunistic
	* Diabetic foot infections


## Enterococci

Enterococci are:

:::column-margin
Enterococci were once considered **Group D** streptococci, but have broken out into their own genus based on DNA analysis and other things. They are included here for posterity and convenience.
:::

* Normal gut flora 
* May be α/β/γ-haemolytic
* Can **survive** in **the presence of bile** and high-salt solutions\
**And other detergents**, including cleaning chemicals.
* Are naturally resistant to β-lactams, and commonly resistant to other agents


Enterococci include:

* *E. faecalis*
* *E. faecium*\
Generally more resistant.


## Management

**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
	* ***S. pneumoniae***\
	Commonly resistant to penicillins and other β-lactams:
		* Empiric therapy generally consists of:
			* Vancomycin
			* Ceftriaxone 1-2g IV Q12-24H or Cefotaxime 2g IV Q4-6H 
	* **Group A**
		* Benzylpenicillin\
		Resistance not developed.
	* **Group B**
		* Benzylpenicillin
		* Ampicillin\
		Alternative to benzylpenicillin.
		* Cephazolin\
		Alternative if penicillin allergy.
		* Clindamycin\
		Alternative if resistance to β-lactams.
		* Vancomycin\
		Alternative if penicillin allergy and clindamycin resistant.
* Procedural
	* Source control


**Preventative**:

* Pneumococcal vaccine
