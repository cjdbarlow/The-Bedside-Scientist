# Sepsis

A **life-threatening organ dysfunction** due to a **dysregulated** host **response to infection**, where:

:::column-margin
The definition of sepsis has remained necessarily vague, as the clinical diagnosis of sepsis is based on a constellation of non-specific features. Drawing a line which neatly includes the septic and excludes other illnesses is therefore not currently possible.\
\
This is the [Sepsis-3](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2492881) definition, which moved the definitional goalposts from trying to pin down "sepsis" to trying to identify patients with clinically suspected infection who had a high mortality.
:::

* **Organ dysfunction**\
⩾2 ↑ in SOFA score.
* **Septic shock**\
Sepsis, with:
	* ↓ BP requiring vasopressors
	* Lactate >2mmol/L


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Major global healthcare burden:

* High number of cases
* High mortality\
~30%.

Host response is highly heterogenous, and is affected by:

* Patient factors:
	* Comorbidities
	* Genetics
* Pathogen factors:
	* Pathogen virulence
	* Location of infection


## Pathophysiology

Progression from a localised infection to systemic involvement requires:

* Activation of pattern-recognition receptors
	* Toll-like receptors
	* C-type lectin receptors
	* Retinoic acid inducible gene-1-like receptors
* Receptor activation leads to complex, simultaneous alteration of multiple metabolic pathways:
	* Pro-inflammatory
	* Anti-inflammatory\
	Simultaneously with pro-inflammatory processes.
	* Neurohormonal
	* Metabolic change
	* Coagulation activation\
	Tend towards a prothrombotic, antifibrionolytic state which may promote microvascular thrombosis and organ ischaemia.
	* Macrovascular dysfunction
	* Microvascular dysfunction
	* Endothelial dysfunction
		* Glycocalyx disruption resulting in ↑ fluid extravasation


Immune paralysis:

* Survival of the initial septic phase may lead to:

* A dysfunctional immune system
* Infections classically associated with immunocompromise


Vasodilation occurs via several mechanisms:

* Acidosis
	* K^+^ efflux leading to membrane hyperpolarisation\
	↓ Ca^2+^ entry into vascular smooth muscle.
	* Catecholamine resistance
* ↑ NO production\
Induced by cytokines and bacterial endotoxin.
* Adrenal suppression
* Endovenous vasopressin suppression


Septic cardiomyopathy:

* ↓ Diastolic function

### Aetiology

Any progression of localised infection may lead to sepsis; the most common in adults include:

* Lung\
~60%.
* Abdominal\
~20%.
* Primary bacteraemia
* Renal or GU

:::column-margin
Lung causes are less common in children, with the difference made up with CNS infections and ↑ primary bacteraemia.
:::

Organisms most commonly associated with sepsis include:

* Gram negative\
60%.
	* *Pseudomonas*\
	20%.
	* *E. coli*\
	15%.
* Gram positive
	* *S. aureus*\
	20%.
* Fungi

## Clinical Manifestations

Heterogenous and non-specific features:

* Tachycardia
* Temperature
	* 35% normothermic
	* 10% hypothermic
	* 55% hyperthermic\
		* Often fluctuant
		* Less likely to be present in the:
			* Elderly
			* Immunosuppressed
			* Malnourished

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

Diagnosis of sepsis is difficult.

* Clinical
	* Signs are non-specific
		* Changes with local infection
		* May not be present in:
			* Elderly
			* Immunocompromised
	* Findings may reflect other forms of shock
* Laboratory
	* Markers are non-specific
	* Microbiological samples:
		* Take significant time to process\
		Requires treatment to be initiated in advance of knowing.
		* Must distinguish infection from colonisation\
		Requires clinical interpretation.

:::column-margin
The qSOFA is a quick screening tool to identify patients who should be *considered* for sepsis workup, and requires **⩾2 of**:

* Altered mentation
* RR >22
* SBP <100mmHg
:::

## Investigations

Laboratory:
	* Blood
		* CRP
			* Non-specific marker of inflammation
				* May be more specific for *Strep. pneumonia* infection\
				This may also better identify patients in whom steroid would be appropriate. 
			* Rises 4-6 hours after onset of infection, doubles ~8 hourly
			* Correlates with severity of infection
				* Rapid ↓ indicates response
		* Procalcitonin
			* Relatively more specific marker of inflammation\
			Elevated in:
				* Bacterial infection\
				Produced in response to bacterial endotoxin.
					* Levels rise in 6-8 hours\
					Prior to cultures flagging positive.
					* Not ↑ in viral or fungal infections
					* Not ↑ in local bacterial infection without a systemic response
				* Burns
				* TLS
				* Major surgery
				* Multi-organ failure
				* ESRD\
				Renally cleared.
			* No better than clinical judgment in discriminating infectious vs. non-infectious causes
			* Expensive, requires serial measurements


## Management

:::info
Principles are:

* Early antibiotics (<1 hour) with blood cultures (2-3 sets) prior
* Determine haemodynamic goals and target with
	* Fluids
	* Vasopressors
:::

**Resuscitation**:\

:::column-margin
Each hour delay in antibiotic administration is associated with a 12% ↓ in survival.
:::

* C
	* **Target MAP** >65mmHg\
	Consider ↑ (e.g. MAP >70mmHg) if renal failure, poorly controlled hypertension.
	* **Fluid resuscitation**\
	10-20mL/kg up to 30mL/kg total.
		* Crystalloid most effective
			* Albumin equivalent outcomes with potentially ↓ total volume delivered, and haemodynamic goals are achieved move quickly
			* Starch harmful
		* Use dynamic measures of fluid responsiveness to assess need for more therapy
			* Passive leg raise
			* Pulse pressure variation
	* **Arterial line**\
	If vasopressors.
	* **Vasopressors**
		* Noradrenaline 1^st^ line
			* ↑ Preload due to *veno*constriction
			* ↑ SVR due to vasoconstriction
			* Maintain or ↑ CO\
			B~1~ effects ↑ CO, compensating for ↑ in afterload.
		* Consider adrenaline as 2^nd^ line
		* Vasopressin as 3^rd^ line
		* End-of-the line vasopressor options without much supporting evidence include:
			* Methylene blue\
			1mg/kg bolus over ~30 minutes.
			* Hydroxycobalamin\
			5g.
			* Terlipressin
			* Angiotensin II
	* **Assess CO**
		* **Inotropic support** if:
			* Adequately volume resuscitated
			* Evidence of ↓ perfusion:
				* ↑ Lactate
				* ↓ Central capillary refill
				* Echocardiography
			* Pre-existing LV dysfunction
		* VA ECMO\
		Appropriate in selected patients with myocardial dysfunction, acknowledging high mortality of this cohort.

### Anaesthetic Considerations

### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

Drugs:

* **Corticosteroids**
	* Controversial
	* Appropriate for patients:
		* With another indication for steroids
		* Sepsis with CAP
	* *May* be appropriate in septic patients:
		* Refractory to vasopressors
		* Otherwise high risk
	* Unlikely to change mortality or outcome
	* Will spare vasopressors
* β-blockade
	* Esmolol probably most well studied
		* Very high control group mortality
		* May reflect reversal of harmful exogenous β-agonists 
* Activated protein C
* Vitamin C


Resuscitation targets:

* CVP targeting
* ScvO~2~ targeting
* PAC targeting\
Use of PAC does not improve and may worsen outcome.


Blood purification therapies:

* High-volume haemofiltration\
CRRT with target dose >35mL/kg/hr.
* Polymyxin B Haemoperfusion\
CRRT with Polymyxin B bound to the filter, which binds bacterial endotoxin.
* High cut-off haemofiltration\
CRRT with larger pores, allowing filtration of middle-molecular weight proteins which include pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines.


Other:

* Hydroxy-ethyl starch resuscitation fluids\
↑ AKI and mortality.

## Complications

Complications of sepsis include:

* B
	* ARDS
* C
	* Septic cardiomyopathy
* D
	* Septic encephalopathy\
	Impaired mental function in the setting of extracranial infection.
		* 10-80%
* F
	* AKI

### Septic AKI

Epidemiology of septic AKI:

* Occurs in 22% of ICU patients with sepsis
* Associated with ↑ din mortality to 38%


Management:

* Preventative\
Most effective method:
	* Low dose vasopressors\
	Achieving a **MAP >80mmHg** may reduce requirement for RRT.
	* Note that excessive**IV fluid is *in*effective**
		* May worsen oedema\
		Aim euvolaemia.
		* Septic AKI is **not a low-flow state**
		* Balanced solutions are beneficial
		* Avoid starch and gelatin colloids
	* Treat the sepsis

## Prognosis

High mortality:

* ICU death 28-40%\
~30% when adjusted for severityu.

## Key Studies

Fluid studies:

* FEAST
* SOAP
* SAFE
* ALBIOS
* CHEST
* VAAST
* [CLOVERS](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2212663)
	* ~12,000 patients with sepsis and hypotension after 1L IVT
		* Within 24 hours of hospital admission
		* \<3L of IVT\
		i.e. 1-3L of IVT received by randomisation.
	* Restrictive vs. liberal fluid strategy
		* Restrictive: Up to 2L IVT, then noradrenaline\
		Rescue fluids allowed.
		* Liberal: 2L bolus at randomisation, further 500mL boluses\
		Rescue vasopressors allowed, and recommended after 5L (6-8L total) IVT.
	* No change in mortality, ventilator free days, ICU free days, ARDS
	* ↑ ICU admission in restrictive group
	* Strong safety profile of peripheral vasopressors


Early Goal Directed Therapy studies:

:::column-margin
Early Goal-Directed Therapy is (?was) a protocolised pathway for sepsis management, targeting specific haemodynamic goals in order to maximise DO~2~ and thus restore cellular oxygen balance:

* CVP 8-12mmHg
* MAP 65-90mmHg
* UO >0.5mL/kg/hr
* ScvO~2~ >70%
* Haematocrit >30%

The comfort of this physiological approach did not survive the crucible of real-word RCT evaluation, and EGDT has been subsequently dismissed. However, the principles of aggressive, goal-directed (but not CVP and ScvO~2~-directed) therapy live on.
:::

* Rivers et al.
	* Single-centre, non-randomised, non-blinded trial
	* High control group mortality (46.5%)
	* Use of ScvO~2~ target was not based on prior evidence
	* Effect may be due to presence of experience clinician at the bedside directing therapy
* ARISE
* ProCESS
* ProMISE


Steroid studies:

:::column-margin
The rationale for steroids is that they *may*:

* C
	* Limit ↓ inotropy due to bacterial endotoxin
	* ↑ Catecholamine function
	* ↓ NO synthetase production
* I
	* Correct adrenal insufficiency
	* Dampen hyperactive immune response
:::

* CORTICUS
* ADRENAL
* APROCCHSS

Vitamin C Studies:

* [LOVIT](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2200644)
	* 872 adults with suspected infection requiring ICU admission and vasopressors in Canada, France, and New Zealand
	* 50mg/kg Vitamin C vs Placebo
	* Significantly ↑ death (44.5% vs 38.5%) and persistent organ dysfunction (9.1% vs 6.9%) in vitamin C group 
* CITRIS-ALI

:::column-margin
The rationale for Vitamin C is that:

* Levels are ↓ in the critically ill
* Oxidative stress is ↑ in the critically ill
* Vitamin C has antioxidant effects that may alleviate some oxidative stress
