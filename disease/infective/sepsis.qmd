# Sepsis

A life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection.


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Host response is highly heterogenous, and is affected by:

* Patient factors:
	* Comorbidities
	* Genetics
* Pathogen factors:
	* Pathogen virulence
	* Location of infection


## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

## Clinical Manifestations


### History

### Examination

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

## Management

### Anaesthetic Considerations

### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

## Complications

Complications of sepsis include:

* D
	* Septic encephalopathy\
	Impaired mental function in the setting of extracranial infection.
		* 10-80%
		* 
* F
	* AKI

### Septic AKI

Epidemiology of septic AKI:

* Occurs in 22% of ICU patients with sepsis
* Associated with ↑ din mortality to 38%


Management:

* Preventative  
Most effective method:
	* Low dose vasopressors  
	Achieving a **MAP >80mmHg** may reduce requirement for RRT.
	* Note that excessive**IV fluid is *in*effective**
		* May worsen oedema  
		Aim euvolaemia.
		* Septic AKI is **not a low-flow state**
		* Balanced solutions are beneficial
		* Avoid starch and gelatin colloids
	* Treat the sepsis

## Prognosis


## Key Studies

Early Goal Directed Therapy studies:

* ARISE
* ProCESS
* ProMISE


Fluid studies:

* [CLOVERS](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2212663)
	* ~12,000 patients with sepsis and hypotension after 1L IVT
		* Within 24 hours of hospital admission
		* \<3L of IVT\
		i.e. 1-3L of IVT received by randomisation.
	* Restrictive vs. liberal fluid strategy
		* Restrictive: Up to 2L IVT, then noradrenaline\
		Rescue fluids allowed.
		* Liberal: 2L bolus at randomisation, further 500mL boluses\
		Rescue vasopressors allowed, and recommended after 5L (6-8L total) IVT.
	* No change in mortality, ventilator free days, ICU free days, ARDS
	* ↑ ICU admission in restrictive group
	* Strong safety profile of peripheral vasopressors
