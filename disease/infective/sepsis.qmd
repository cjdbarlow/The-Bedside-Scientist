# Sepsis

A life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection.


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Host response is highly heterogenous, and is affected by:

* Patient factors:
	* Comorbidities
	* Genetics
* Pathogen factors:
	* Pathogen virulence
	* Location of infection


## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

## Clinical Manifestations


### History

### Examination

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

## Management

### Anaesthetic Considerations

### Ineffective Therapies

## Complications

Complications of sepsis include:

* AKI

### Septic AKI

Epidemiology of septic AKI:

* Occurs in 22% of ICU patients with sepsis
* Associated with ↑ din mortality to 38%


Management:

* Preventative  
Most effective method:
	* Low dose vasopressors  
	Achieving a **MAP >80mmHg** may reduce requirement for RRT.
	* Note that excessive**IV fluid is *in*effective**
		* May worsen oedema  
		Aim euvolaemia.
		* Septic AKI is **not a low-flow state**
		* Balanced solutions are beneficial
		* Avoid starch and gelatin colloids
	* Treat the sepsis

## Prognosis


## Key Studies

Early Goal Directed Therapy studies:

* ARISE
* ProCESS
* ProMISE
