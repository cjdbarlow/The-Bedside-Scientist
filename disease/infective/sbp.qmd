# Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis

Spontaneous infection of (usually cirrhosis-associated) ascites, which may present as:

* Florid sepsis
* Insidious decline

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Risk factors:

* Liver dysfunction
* Variceal bleeding
* Previous SBP

## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

## Clinical Manifestations

History:

* Abdominal pain
* Confusion


Examination:

* Fever

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

:::caution
Mortality approaches 80% if an unnecessary laparotomy is performed, so it is vital to distinguish SBP from secondary peritonitis.
:::


Key differentials:

* Secondary peritonitis
	* Bowel perforation

## Investigations

Pathology:

* Ascitic tap\
Required for diagnosis.
	* Usually **low** bacterial **concentrations** of a **single organism**
	* 10-20mL should be placed into blood culture bottles to increase yield

## Management


**Resuscitation**:\

**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
	* Antibiotics
		* Paracentesis should be repeated at 48 hours
	* 20% Albumin
		* ↓ AKI
		* Substantial ↓ mortality
* Procedural
* Physical

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:

* Prophylactic antibiotics\
May be appropriate in high risk patients; agents include:
	* Rifaximin
	* Norfloxacin
	* Ciprofloxacin

### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

## Anaesthetic Considerations

## Complications

## Prognosis

Features associated with ↑ mortality include:

* Resistant organism

## Key Studies
