# Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis

**Infection** of **ascitic** fluid occurring in absence of any evident infective source, which may present as:

:::column-margin
SBP is generally a monomicrobial infection. **Multiple organisms** suggests **secondary peritonitis** from faecal contamination, which is a surgical disease.
:::

* Florid sepsis
* Insidious decline

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Risk factors:

:::column-margin
Child-Pugh score is covered under @sec-childpugh.
:::

* Previous SBP
* Invasive devices
* Hepatic dysfunction
	* Child-Pugh Grade C
	* Variceal bleeding
* Infection
	* UTI
	* Intestinal bacterial overgrowth

## Pathophysiology

Major factors:

* Ascites is a ready-made, continuously available viable culture medium
* Immunosuppression secondary to chronic liver disease


### Aetiology

Causative organisms:

* *E. coli*: 37%
* *K. pneumoniae*: 17%
* Other Gram positives: 14%
* *S. pneumoniae*: 12%
* Other gram negatives: 10%
* *S. viridans*: 9%

## Clinical Manifestations

Features include:

:::column-margin
Asymptomatic in ~10%.
:::

* Fever: 70%
* Abdominal pain: 50%
	* Tenderness: 40%
	* Rebound: 10%
* Confusion
	* Altered level of consciousness: 54%


## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

:::caution
Mortality approaches 80% if an unnecessary laparotomy is performed, so it is vital to distinguish SBP from secondary peritonitis.
:::

Key differentials:

* Secondary peritonitis\
Indicated by:
	* Peritonism
	* Localising abdominal pain
	* Multiple organisms on Gram stain
	* Failure of antibiotic therapy
	* Ascitic fluid findings\
	Two of:
		* Protein >1g/dL
		* Glucose <3mmol/L
		* LDH > ULN of serum LDH


## Investigations

**Laboratory**:

* Ascitic tap\
Required for diagnosis.
	* Usually **low** bacterial **concentrations** of a **single organism**
	* Consider using a micropuncture kit (e.g. 21G spinal needle) to ↓ risk of continual leak from puncture site
	* 10-20mL should be placed into blood culture bottles to increase yield
	* Diagnostic criteria:
		* WCC >250/mm^3^
		* Evidence of bacteria\
		Usually only **one**.
	* Paracentesis should be repeated at 48 hours after microbial therapy

:::column-margin
Cirrhotic patients with large volume ascites should be tapped on ICU admission irrespective of their admission diagnosis, as ~10% will be complicated with SBP
:::

:::column-margin
![Turbid Ascites](/resources/turbid_ascites.jpg)
:::

**Imaging**:

* CT\
If concern for secondary peritonitis.

## Management

:::priority
* Appropriate **antibiotics**
* Give **20% albumin**
* **Cease nephrotoxins** and **antihypertensives**
* Consider repeat **paracentesis**
:::


**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
	* Antibiotics\
	Choice is contextual, however:
		* Ceftriaxone 2g IV daily
		* Tazocin 4.5g IV TDS\
		If resistant species, nosocomial infection, or septic shock.
	* 20% Albumin
		* 1.5g/kg IV, then 1g/kg 48 hours later
		* ↓ AKI
		* Substantial ↓ mortality by ↓ hepatorenal syndrome
* Procedural
	* Repeat paracentesis\
	At 48 hours to evaluate for treatment failure; unnecessary if organism is susceptible and there is clinical improvement.


**Supportive care**:

* C
	* Cease β-blockade\
	Many patients will be on propranolol for variceal haemorrhage prophylaxis, which will ↓ CO in the septic state.
* G
	* Feeding
		* ↓ Bacterial translocation
	* Cease PPI
	* Rifaximin 400mg PO TDS


**Disposition**:

* Ongoing prophylactic antibiotics\
May be appropriate in high risk patients; agents include:
	* Rifaximin
	* Norfloxacin
	* Ciprofloxacin


### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

## Anaesthetic Considerations

## Complications

* B
	* Pleural effusion
		* May occur when there is communication betwen the abdomena nd pleura
		* Thoracocentesis is indicated for:
			* Respiratory failure
			* Clinical suspicion of empyema 

## Prognosis

Features associated with ↑ mortality include:

* Resistant organism
