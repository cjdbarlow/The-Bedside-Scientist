# Legionellosis {#sec-legionella}

:::info
The pneumonic form of legionellosis is also known as **Legionnaires' disease**, and the non-pneumonic form as **Pontiac fever**. This section focuses on the pneumonic form.
:::

Legionellosis is an umbrella term encompassing infection with the *Legionella* bacterium which is transmitted by inhalation of aerosols from contaminated water or soil, and is divided into:

* **Pneumonic form**
	* 2-10 day incubation
	* Constitutional symptoms
	* Mild to severe pneumonia
		* Haemoptysis is common
	* 5-10% mortality
	* Weeks-months duration
* **Non-pneumonic form**
	* 4-48 hour incubation
	* Acute, self-limiting flu-like illness
	* 2-5 day duration


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Epidemiology:

* ~2/100,000
* 1-10% of CAP

Risk factors:

* Age
* Male
* Smoking
* Heavy alcohol use
* Pulmonary disease


## Pathophysiology

*Legionella* is:

* Gram negative
* Aerobic
* Intracellular
	* May also infect protozoa
	* Aspirated bacteria attach to alveolar macrophages and epithelium
* Fastidious



### Aetiology

Transmission occurs via inhalation of contaminated aerosols from contaminated water, and not by human-human transmission. There are >60 strains; key pathogenic strains include:

* ***L. pneumophila***
	* National and artificial systems\
		* Grow at 20-50°C
		* Contamination occurs when changes in water behaviour disrupt biofilms, releasing a bacterial bolus into the water
	* Most prevalent strain\
	Serotype 1 causes >80% of all cases worldwide.
* ***L. longbeachae***
	* Potting mixes
	* Soil
	* Second most prevalent strain\
	Particularly in Australia and New Zealand.
* *L. micdadei*
* *L. bozemanii*
* *L. feeleii*
* *L. anisa*
* *L. dumoffii*

Possible sources include:

* Air conditioning cooling towers
* Hot and cold water systems
* Humidifiers
* Whirlpool spas
* Water birth
:::

## Assessment

Common clinical features include:

{{< include /includes/flu_like.qmd >}}
* Nausea
* Vomiting

:::column-margin
Fever and fatigue typically proceed the onset of cough.
:::


Extra-pulmonary infections are rare, but may include:

* Cellulitis
* Abscesses
* Endocarditis
* Meningitis

### History


### Examination

* Crepitations


### Investigations

**Bedside**:

**Laboratory**:

* Blood
	* FBE
	* LFT
		* ↑ ALT/AST
	* UEC
		* ↓ Na~+~
	* CRP >100
* Sputum
	* Deep respiratory sample PCR\
	Preferred diagnostic test as it detects all species and has high diagnostic accuracy.
	* Culture
		* Requires rapid processing\
		Poor survival in secretions.
* Urine
	* Antigen\
	Only detects *L. pneumophila* serotype 1.


**Imaging**:

:::column-margin
![Legionella Pneumonia](/resources/legionella_pneumonia.png)
:::

* CXR
	* Patchy unilobular infiltrates

**Other**:

### Diagnostic Approach and DDx

:::caution
Legionnaire's disease should be considered in any patient with:

* Moderate-severe pneumonia
* Possible exposure to *Legionella*
* Immunocompromise
:::

Features differentiating Legionnaire's disease from other causes of CAP include:

* GIT symptoms
* ↑ ALT/AST
* ↓ Na~+~
* CRP >100
* **Failure to respond to beta-lactam** monotherapy

## Management

:::priority
* Early antimicrobial therapy
* Respiratory support
:::

**Resuscitation**:

**Specific therapy**:

:::column-margin
"Atypical cover" in standard empiric CAP regimens are designed to cover (among others) *Legionella*, and is covered in detail under @sec-pneumonia. Note that unlike fluoroquinolones, macrolides or tetracyclines alone do not provide adequate empiric CAP cover.
:::

* Pharmacological
	* Antimicrobial\
	5-day course of either:
		* Macrolide
			* Azithromycin 500mg PO load, then 250mg PO daily
			* Clarithromycin 500mg PO BD, then 1g PO daily
		* Tetracycline
			* Doxycycline 100mg PO BD\
			*L. longbeachae* is commonly resistant.
		* Fluoroquinolones
			* Levofloxacin
			* Moxifloxacin
* Procedural
* Physical

:::column-margin
**Macrolides are preferred** because they are bactericidal, have excellent pulmonary tissue penetration, and are active against all pathogenic strains.
:::

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:

**Preventative**:

* Water safety plans
	* Regular maintenance
	* Drift eliminators\
	↓ Aerosol dissemination.
	* Biocide use\
	e.g. Chlorine.
	* Temperature control
		* Hot water >50°C
		* Cold <25°C\
		Ideally <20°C.
	* Flush water sources regularly
* Work with soil in a well ventilated area


### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

## Anaesthetic Considerations

## Complications

* Death
	* 5-10%
	* Up to 40% in immunocompromised

## Prognosis

## Key Studies
