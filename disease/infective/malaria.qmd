# Malaria

*Anopheles* mosquito-borne protozoal infection endemic in tropical and subtropical regions, caused by four species of the *Plasmodium* genus:

* *P. falciparum*
	* Most severe form
	* Parasite-infected RBC may obstruct capillaries leading to localised tissue ischaemia and organ-dependent dysfunction
* *P. vivax*
* *P. malariae*
* *P. ovale*

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors


Risk factors for malaria:

* Patient factors
	* Age <3
	* Non-immune
	* Pregnant
* Environmental factors
	* Mosquito carrier\
	Classically *anopheline*, which are:
		* Night feeders\
		Dawn to dusk is the most dangerous time.
		* Rural breeders\
		Generally ↓↓ risk in urban areas, even in endemic regions.

## Pathophysiology

Life-cycle:

* Uninucleate sporozoites resident in mosquito salivary glands are injected into a human host during feeding
* Sporozoites rapidly invade liver parenchyma and mature into **schizonts**
	* Bursting of schizonts releases 2,000 to 40,000 merozoites, each of which can infective a single RBC
	* Maturation may take 1-2 years in *P. vivax* and *P. ovale* infections
* Merozoites mature in the RBC into either:
	* Gametocyte\
	If ingested by a mosquito during feeding, will mature in the mosquito gut over 2-3 weeks into new sporozoites.
	* Erythrocytic schizont containing more merozoites\
	Subsequent **rupture** of the erythrocyte releases the merozoites, and causes the cyclical fever.

The erythrocytic stage is the disease-causing stage; sporozoites and gametocytes are not associated with disease.

### Aetiology

## Clinical Manifestations

Cyclical fevers are classical, and occur in **three stages**:

:::column-margin
Cyclical symptoms occur when maturing malarial schizonts rupture their erythrocyte host, the timing of which varies on the strain:

* Tertian malaria\
Maturation every 48 hours.
	* *P. vivax*
	* *P. ovale*
* Quartan malaria\
Maturation every 72 hours.
	* *P. malariae*

Falciparum is typically every 48 hours, but shows can be irregular.

* 15-60 minutes cold shivering 
* 2-6 hour fever (up to 41°C)  
* 2-4 hour sweating\           
↓ Temperature.

|                         | * Haemoglobinuria  |
|                         | * Haemolysis       |
|                         | * DIC              |

: Features of Malaria


## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

Bedside:

Laboratory:

* Blood
	* FBE
		* Normochromic normocytic anaemia
		* Thrombocytopaenia
	* LFTs
	* UECs
	* Blood smears\
	**Thick and thin films** are gold standard of diagnosis:
		* Thin films identify parasites within red cells
		* Thick films allow parasite counting
	* Rapid diagnostic tests\
	Look for parasite-specific antigen. Qualitative evidence of disease.
	* Malaria PCR\
	More sensitive than antigen testing with similar limitations.

Thick and thin films refer to the thickness of the blood on the slide.

## Management

**Resuscitation**:\

ABC approach. Comment on team coordination and clinical priorities.
**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
* Procedural
* Physical

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:

**Preventative**:


### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

* Steroids\
Worsen outcome.
* IVIg\
Worsen outcome.


## Anaesthetic Considerations

## Complications

* B
	* ARDS
* C
	* Septic shock
* D
	* Cerebral malaria\
		* Mental status abnormality in a patient with malaria
		* Due to obstruction of cerebral capillary blood flow
		* 15-50% mortality
* E
	* Hypoglycaemia
	* Electrolyte derangements
	* Rhabdomyolysis
* F
	* AKI
	* ATN\
	Secondary to haemoglobinuria and rhabdomyolysis.
* H
	* DIC
	* Thrombocytopenia

## Prognosis

Death associated with:

* Age <3
* Cerebral malaria
* Organ failures
* Anaemia
