# Malaria

*Anopheles* mosquito-borne protozoal infection endemic in tropical and subtropical regions, caused by four species of the *Plasmodium* genus:

* *P. falciparum*
	* Most severe form
	* Parasite-infected RBC may obstruct capillaries leading to localised tissue ischaemia and organ-dependent dysfunction
* *P. vivax*
* *P. malariae*
* *P. ovale*

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Risk factors for malaria:

* Patient factors
	* Age <3
	* Non-immune
* Environmental factors
	* Mosquito carrier\
	Specifically the female *Anopheles*, which are:
		* Night feeders\
		Dawn to dusk is the most dangerous time.
		* Rural breeders\
		Generally ↓↓ risk in urban areas, even in endemic regions.


Severe malaria associated iwth:

* Children <5
* Non-immune travelers
* Immunosuppression
	* Pregnancy


## Pathophysiology

Life-cycle:

* Uninucleate **sporozoites** resident in mosquito salivary glands are injected into a human host during feeding
* **Sporozoites** rapidly **invade** **liver** parenchyma and **mature** into **schizonts**
	* **Bursting** of **schizonts releases** 2,000 to 40,000 **merozoites**, each of which can infect a single RBC
	* Maturation may take 1-2 years in *P. vivax* and *P. ovale* infections
* **Merozoites mature in** the **RBC into** either:
	* **Gametocyte**\
	If ingested by a mosquito during feeding, will mature in the mosquito gut over 2-3 weeks into new sporozoites.
	* Erythrocytic **schizont**\
	Contain more merozoites; subsequent **rupture** releases merozoites and causes the cyclical fever.

:::column-margin
The erythrocytic stage is the disease-causing stage; sporozoites and gametocytes are not associated with disease.
:::

:::column-margin
Sickled cells (see @sec-hbs) haemolyse prematurely, interrupting the *Plasmodium* life-cycle.

### Aetiology

## Clinical Features

Presentations are divided into:

:::column-margin
Cyclical symptoms occur when maturing malarial schizonts rupture their erythrocyte host, the timing of which varies on the strain:

* Tertian malaria\
Maturation every 48 hours.
	* *P. vivax*
	* *P. ovale*
* Quartan malaria\
Maturation every 72 hours.
	* *P. malariae*
* *P. Falciparum*\
Typically irregular fever spikes every 48 hours on the background of a continuous fever, but may also produce tertian malaria.

:::

* Uncomplicated\
Generic viral symptoms, progressing to classical **cyclical fevers**.
* Severe malaria\
Progression to organ dysfunction, most common with *P. falciparum* infection.

+-------------------------+--------------------+
| Uncomplicated           | Severe             |
+=========================+====================+
| * Cyclical fever\       | * Pulmonary oedema |
| In established disease. | * ARDS             |
| * Headache              | * Septic shock\    |
| * Jaundice              | Lactic acidosis.   |
| * Hepatosplenomegaly    | * Coma             |
| * Myalgia               | * Severe weakness\ |
|                         | "Prostration."     |
|                         | * AKI              |
|                         | * Haemoglobinuria  |
|                         | * Haemolysis       |
|                         | * DIC              |

: Features of Malaria

Cyclical fevers are the classical finding, and occur in **three stages**:

* 15-60 minutes cold shivering 
* 2-6 hour fever (up to 41°C)  
* 2-4 hour sweating\           
Normalisation of temperature.                 


## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

**Bedside**:

**Laboratory**:

* Blood
	* FBE
		* Normochromic normocytic anaemia
		* Thrombocytopaenia
	* LFTs
	* UECs
	* Blood smears\
	**Thick and thin films** are gold standard of diagnosis:
		* Thin films identify parasites within red cells
		* Thick films allow parasite counting\
		\>10% of RBCs containing parasites indicates severe disease.
	* Rapid diagnostic tests\
	Look for parasite-specific antigen. Qualitative evidence of disease.
	* Malaria PCR\
	More sensitive than antigen testing with similar limitations.

## Management

:::priority
* **Preventative antimalarials** when visiting endemic areas
* Standard **sepsis management**\
Covered under @sec-sepsis_mx.
* **Antimalarials**
:::

**Resuscitation**:

* C
	* Fluid boluses ↑ mortality in children


**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
	* **Antimalarials**
		* Combination therapy recommended due to *P. falciparum* resistance
		* Chloroquines kill mature parasites, immature parasites mature despite ongoing treatment


**Preventative**:

* Pharmacological
	* Malarial prophylaxis
* Physical
	* Mosquito nets


### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

* Steroids\
Worsen outcome.
* IVIG\
Worsen outcome.
* Exchange transfusion\
Cytapheresis with replacement of native RBCs with donor RBCs, sometimes used if >10% parasitaemia. No indication of mortality benefit.


## Anaesthetic Considerations

## Complications

* B
	* ARDS
* C
	* Septic shock
* D
	* Cerebral malaria\
	Mental status abnormality in a patient with malaria without another cause.
		* Due to obstruction of cerebral capillary blood flow, or efffect of malarial toxin
		* Coma
		* Convulsions
		* ↑ ICP
		* ↓ BSL
		* Tone and postural abnormalties\
		Symmetrical pyramidal signs.
		* Retinopathy
		* 15-50% mortality
* E
	* Hypoglycaemia
	* Electrolyte derangements
	* Rhabdomyolysis
* F
	* AKI
	* ATN\
	Secondary to haemoglobinuria and rhabdomyolysis.
* H
	* DIC
	* Thrombocytopenia

## Prognosis

Death associated with:

* Age <3
* Cerebral malaria
* Organ failures
* Anaemia
