# Meningitis

Inflammation of the meninges and subarachnoid space, that can be divided into:

* **Infective** meningitis
	* Bacterial\
	Severe disease with high mortality in absence of treatment.
	* Viral\
	Relatively benign, self-limiting disease.
	* Yeast
* **Aseptic** meningitis\
Inflammation where bacteria cannot be isolated from CSF, and includes:
	* **Occult infective** causes
		* Viral meningitis\
		Most common.
		* Partially treated bacterial meningitis
		* Tuberculosis meningitis\
		Subacute lymphocytic meningitis. Non-specific prodromal phase.
		* Fungal meningitis
	* Non-infective causes
		* Lymphoma
		* Sarcoidosis
		* Drug-induced meningitis
		* Vascular disease

Meningitis in the immunocompromised can present with non-specific features and with more exotic causative organisms.

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

General risk factors:

* Immunosuppression
* Extremes of age
* Cochlear implants
* CSF leak


For meningococcal meningitis:

* Unvaccinated


For pneumococcal meningitis:

* Splenectomy
* Unvaccinated

## Pathophysiology

Series of processes:

* Infection\
Predominantly via droplet or saliva. Common routes include:
	* Nasopharyngeal colonisation
	* Middle ear
	* Sinusitis
	* Dental
* Cytokine production
* Meningitis
* Hydrocephalus
	* ↑ ICP
	* ↓ CPP
* Vasculitis
* Thrombosis

### Aetiology

Community acquired:

* Bacterial:
	* ***S. pneumoniae***
	* ***N. meningitidis***
		* Peak incidence in first year of life\
		Following loss of maternal antibody, and prior to development of new antibody.
		* Rare in the immunocompetent adult
		* Characteristic:
			* Myalgias and arthralgias
			* Purpuric or petechial rash\
			May progress to purpura fulminans.
		* Exquisitely antibiotic sensitive
		* Complicated by:
			* Adrenal insufficiency secondary to acute adrenal haemorrhage
			Waterhouse-Friedrichsen syndrome.
			* Pericarditis
	* ***H. influenzae***\
	Most common cause prior to vaccination.
	* *L. monocytogenes*
	Rare, and generally confined to the lightly immunocompromised:
		* Elderly
		* Splenectomy
		* Alcohol dependency
		* Diabetes
		* Malignancy
* Viral:
	* Enteroviruses
		* Coxsackie
	* Herpes simplex
	* Mumps
	* Echoviruses
	* Toscana virus

Purpura fulminans is covered in detail at @sec-pf.

Nosocomial:

:::column-margin
Nosocomial meningitis is **rare**.
:::

* *Staphylococcus* spp.\
Particularly with intracranial devices, or following neurosurgery.
* *E. coli*
* *Pseudomonas* spp.
* *Klebsiella* spp.
* *Acinetobacter* spp


Immunocompromised:

* *Cryptococcus neoformans*
	* Chronic meningitis
	* Immunocompromised
	* **India ink** stain and antigen testing on CSF
	* ↑↑ Opening pressures
* Tuberculosis meningitis
	* Normal glucose
	* PMN predominance
* Toxoplasmosis


Neonatal:

* Group B Streptococci\
*S. agalactiae*.
* *E. Coli*
* *L. monocytogenes*
* *H. Influenzae*\
Prior to vaccination.


## Clinical Manifestations

Clinical features are typically **rapidly evolving** over hours, and relate to:

:::column-margin
Viral meningitis presents with similar symptoms to bacterial meningitis, but is generally less severe.
:::

* Meningeal inflammation
	* Fever
	* Headache
	* Neck stiffness
	* Photophobia
* Encephalopathy
	* Altered level of consciousness
	* Irritability
	* Seizures\
	Paediatric.
* Causative organism
	* Meningococcal disease
		* Hash\
		Haemorrhagic, petechial, purpuric.
		* Digital gangrene
		* Skin necrosis
		* Signs of coagulopathy

:::column-margin

:::

In the immunocompromised:

* Low-grade fever
* Behavioural changes

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

**Bedside**:

**Laboratory**:

:::column-margin
Details of CSF findings in meningitis are covered under @sec-csf.
:::

* Blood
	* FBE\
	Infection.
	* Blood cultures
	* PCR
* Urine
	* Pneumococcal urinary antigen\
	Significantly ↓ sensitivity for meningitis compared with pneumoniae.
* LP
	* Required to completely confirm diagnosis
	* However, contraindications are common
		* Coagulopathy
		* ↑ ICP, or significant clinical concern of such
	* **Empirical antibiotics should be commenced if there is delay**
	* Urgent **Gram stain** and culture
	* Specific antigen investigations:
		* Herpes simplex PCR
		* Mycobacterium TB PCR
		* Mycobacterial stain and cultures
		* India Ink stain and Cryptococcal antigen
		* Pneumococcal urinary antigen\
		95% sensitive if used on CSF.



**Imaging**:

:::column-margin
Indications for pre-LP CT:

* ↑ BP with ↓ HR
* Focal neurology
* ↓ Conscious state
* New **seizures**
* Predisposition to infection
* History of CVA or space-occupying lesions
* **Papilloedema**
:::

* CT\
↑ ICP or space-occupying lesion.


**Other**:

## Management

**Resuscitation**:\


**Specific therapy**:

:::column-margin
Duration of antimicrobial therapy depends on the organism:

* *N. meningitidis*: 5 days
* *S. pneumoniae*: 10-14 days
* *L. monocytogenes*: 21 days
:::

* Pharmacological
	* Antimicrobial therapy
		* **Empiric therapy**
			* Foundation:
				* **Ceftriaxone** 2g IV Q12H\
				Or cefotaxime 2g IV Q6H.
				* **Dexamethasone** 10mg IV Q6H
					* Give with or before first dose of antibiotics
					* Continue up to 4 days in *S. pneumoniae*, and *H. Influenze* in children.
				* **Acyclovir** 10mg/kg IV\
				Indicated for viral meningitis caused by VZV or HSV.
			* If immunocompromised:\
			i.e. Age >60, diabetes, alcohol misuse, malignancy, immunosuppressants:
				* Add **ampicillin** 2g Q4H
			* If **penicillin resistant** pneumococci:
				* Add **vancomycin**
				* Replace ceftriaxone with **cefepime** or **meropenem**
		* **Cryptococcal meningitis**
			* Initial therapy:
				* Amphotericin B
				* 5-fluorocytosine
			* Fluconazole
	* Anticonvulsants
		* Benzodiazepines for seizure control
* Procedural
* Physical

:::column-margin
Dexamethaxone is associated with:

* ↓ Mortality in *S. pneumoniae*
* ↓ Deafness in adults and in children with *H. Influenzae*
* ↓ Neurological sequelae
:::


:::column-margin
Management of seizures is covered under @sec-seizure.
:::

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:

* ICU admission in:
	* Rapidly evolving rash
	* GCS ⩽12
	* Organ support
	* Seizures


**Preventative:**

* Prophylaxis is recommended for close contacts\
Ciprofloxacin 500mg.
* Meningococcal vaccination
* Public health notification

### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

* Intrathecal antibiotics\
Not recommended.
* Prophylactic anticonvulsants

## Anaesthetic Considerations

## Complications

* Death
* D
	* Hydrocephalus
	* Cerebral infarction
	* Seizure\
	25% of cases.
* H
	* DIC\
	Meningococcal meningitis.

## Prognosis

Bacterial meningitis:

* Usually fatal without treatment
* Mortality ~20%\
↑ In patients with:
	* Seizures
	* Delays to treatment
	* Extremes of age
	* Pneumonococcal meningitis


Viral meningitis:

* Usually lasts 7-10 days


Poor prognostic features:

* Cranial nerve palsies
* ↓ GCS
* ↑ ESR
* ↑ CSF protein
