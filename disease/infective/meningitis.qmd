# Meningitis

Inflammation of the meninges and subarachnoid space, that can be divided into:

* **Infective** meningitis
	* Bacterial\
	Severe disease with high mortality in absence of treatment.
	* Viral\
	Relatively benign, self-limiting disease.
	* Yeast
* **Aseptic** meningitis\
Inflammation where bacteria cannot be isolated from CSF, and includes:
	* Occult infective causes
		* Viral meningitis\
		Most common.
		* Partially treated bacterial meningitis
		* Tuberculosis meningitis\
		Subacute lymphocytic meningitis. Non-specific prodromal phase.
		* Fungal meningitis
	* Non-infective causes
		* Lymphoma
		* Sarcoidosis
		* Drug-induced meningitis
		* Vascular disease

Meningitis in the immunocompromised can present with non-specific features and with more exotic causative organisms.

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

Series of processes:

* Infection\
Predominantly via droplet or saliva. Common routes include:
	* Nasopharyngeal colonisation
	* Middle ear
	* Sinusitis
	* Dental
* Cytokine production
* Meningitis
* Hydrocephalus
	* ↑ ICP
	* ↓ CPP
* Vasculitis
* Thrombosis

### Aetiology

Bacterial meningitis:

* Community
	* *S. pneumoniae*
	* *N. meningitidis*
	* *H. influenzae*\
	Most common prior to vaccination.
	* *L. monocytogenes*
	Rare, and confined to the immunosuppressed:
		* Elderly
		* Alcohol dependency
		* Diabetes
		* Malignancy
* Nosocomial\
**Rare**, but organisms include:
	* *Staphylococcus* spp.\
	Particularly with intracranial devices, or following neurosurgery.
	* *E. coli*
	* *Pseudomonas* spp.
	* *Klebsiella* spp.
	* *Acinetobacter* spp


Viral:

* Enteroviruses
	* Coxsackie
* Herpes simplex
* Mumps
* Echoviruses
* Toscana virus


Yeast:

* *Cryptococcus neoformans*
	* Chronic meningitis
	* Immunocompromised
	* **India ink** stain and antigen testing on CSF


## Clinical Manifestations

Clinical features are typically **rapidly evolving** over hours, and relate to:

:::column-margin
Viral meningitis presents with similar symptoms to bacterial meningitis, but is generally less severe.
:::

* Meningeal inflammation
	* Fever
	* Headache
	* Neck stiffness
	* Photophobia
* Encephalopathy
	* Altered level of consciousness
	* Irritability
	* Seizures\
	Paediatric.
* Causative organism
	* Meningococcal disease
		* Hash\
		Haemorrhagic, petechial, purpuric.
		* Digital gangrene
		* Skin necrosis
		* Signs of coagulopathy

:::column-margin

:::

In the immunocompromised:

* Low-grade fever
* Behavioural changes

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

Bedside:

Laboratory:

:::column-margin
Details of CSF findings in meningitis are covered under @sec-csf.
:::

* Blood
	* FBE\
	Infection.
	* Blood cultures
	 * PCR
* LP
	* Required to completely confirm diagnosis
	* However, contraindications are common
		* Coagulopathy
		* ↑ ICP, or significant clinical concern of such
	* **Empirical antibiotics should be commenced if there is delay**
	* Urgent **Gram stain** and culture

## Management

**Resuscitation**:\


**Specific therapy**:

:::column-margin
Duration of antimicrobial therapy depends on the organism:

* *N. meningitidis*: 5 days
* *S. pneumoniae*: 10-14 days
* *L. monocytogenes*: 21 days
:::

* Pharmacological
	* Antimicrobial therapy
		* **Empiric therapy**
			* Foundation:
				* **Ceftriaxone** 2g IV Q12H\
				Or cefotaxime 2g IV Q6H.
				* **Dexamethasone** 10mg IV Q6H
					* Give with or before first dose of antibiotics
					* Cease if cause *other* than *S. pneumoniae* is discovered\
					No mortality benefit outside this group.
				* **Acyclovir** 10mg/kg IV\
				Indicated for viral meningitis caused by VZV or HSV.
			* If immunocompromised:\
			i.e. Age >60, diabetes, alcohol misuse, malignancy, immunosuppressants:
				* Add **ampicillin** 2g Q4H
			* If **penicillin resistant** pneumococci:
				* Add **vancomycin**
		* **Cryptococcal meningitis**
			* Initial therapy:
				* Amphoteracin B
				* 5-fluorocytosine
			* Fluconazole
	* Anticonvulsants
		* Benzodiazepines for seizure control
		* 
* Procedural
* Physical

:::column-margin
Management of seizures is covered under @sec-seizure.
:::

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:

* ICU admission in:
	* Rapidly evolving rash
	* GCS ⩽12
	* Organ support
	* Seizures


**Preventative:**

* Prophylaxis is recommended for close contacts\
Ciprofloxacin 500mg.
* Meningococcal vaccination
* Public health notification

### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

* Intrathecal antibiotics\
Not recommended.
* Prophylactic anticonvulsants

## Anaesthetic Considerations

## Complications

* Death
* D
	* Hydrocephalus
	* Cerebral infarction
	* Seizure\
	25% of cases.
* H
	* DIC\
	Meningococcal meningitis.

## Prognosis

Bacterial meningitis:

* Usually fatal without treatment
* Mortality ~20%\
↑ In patients with:
	* Seizures
	* Delays to treatment
	* Extremes of age


Viral meningitis:

* Usually lasts 7-10 days
