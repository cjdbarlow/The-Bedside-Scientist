# Tetanus

Non-communicable infection of devitalised tissue by *Clostridium tetani*, which produces an **exotoxin** that causes **life-threatening**:

* **Muscle rigidity**\
Including laryngeal and respiratory muscle spasm.
* **Autonomic instability**\
Haemodynamic lability, including cardiac arrest.
* **Convulsions**

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Significant public health problem of the developing world, due to a combination of:

* High incidence\
Major risk factors include:
	* Unvaccinated
		* LMIC
		* Elderly
	* Rural
	* Poor
* Requirement for prolonged ICU care


## Pathophysiology

*C. tetani* is a gram positive rod and obligate anaerobe that:

* Exists in spore form in the environment
* Is non-invasive\
Requires innoculation into a wound to produce infection - cannot grow in vitalised tissue.
* Produces two **exotoxins**:
	* **Tetanospasmin**
		* LD~50~ 0.01mg
		* Haematological spread
		* Uptake into motor nerve endings, and transport into nervous system
		* Diffuses into interstitium with, and acts on pre-synaptic terminals of nearby neurones\
		Produces **dysfunction** of predominantly **inhibitory interneurons**:
			* Muscle spasms
			* Autonomic dysfunction
			Requires toxin to diffuse to lateral horns.
				* ↑ Sympathetic tone
			* Cognitive dysfunction
	* Tetanolysin\
	Localised tissue destruction; clinically relatively unimportant.

Fun Fact:\
~240g of tetanospasmin could kill the entire world population.
:::


### Aetiology

Mechanisms of *C. tetani* innoculation include:

* **Trauma**
	* Puncture
	* Laceration
	* Dog bites
	* Piercings
* Skin breakdown
	* Burns
	* Chronic ulcers
	* Dental infections
* Other devitalised tissue
	* Abortion
	* Childbirth
	* Tetanus neonatorum\
	Infection of umbilical stump.


## Clinical Manifestations

Presentation:

* Occurs following an **incubation** period\
A shorter incubation period indicates ↑ severity.
	* **Usually >2 days**\
	* **90% <14 days**
	* Up to 60 days
* **Pain**
* **Musculoskeletal** symptoms\
Progression:
	* Stiffness
	* Rigidity
	* **Trismus**\
	Presentation typically at this point, which occurs due to masseter spasm.
	* Risus sardonicus\
	Clenched-teeth expression relating to facial muscle spasm.
* **Autonomic dysfunction**
	* Confined to severe cases
	* Begins after muscle spasms
	* Generally short-duration episodes of:
		* ↑↑ Sympathetic tone
		* ↑↑ Parasympathetic tone
			* Including sudden cardiac arrest\
			Particularly in IVDU.

:::


Tetanus neonatorum presents:

* ~7^th^ day of life
* Short history of failure to feed


## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

Include:

* Local disease
	* Dental
	* TMJ disease
	* Infection
* Neurological disease
	* Epilepsy
* Toxidromes
	* TCA overdose
	* Strychnine poisoning


## Investigations

:::info
No specific laboratory findings - diagnosis is clinical.
:::

Bedside:

* ABG\
Respiratory failure.

Laboratory:

* Bloods
	* UEC\
	Rhabdomyolysis.
	* CMP
* Wound culture\
May grow *C. tetani*.

Imaging:

## Management

:::info
Principles:

* Immunoglobulin to neutralise circulating toxin
* Source control/wound care
* Supportive care
:::


**Resuscitation**:\

* A
	* **Intubation**\
	For control of muscle spasm.
* B
	* Mechanical ventilation\
		* If respiratory muscle involvement
		* **Muscle relaxation** if spasms prevent ventilation\
		No particular agent is preferred.
* C
	* Haemodynamic control\
	Consider:
		* ↓ Catecholamine production
			* **Sedation**\
			May require **hefty** doses, Oh's quotes 3.4 *grams* of diazepam daily.
			* Opioids\
			Heavy doses may also be required.
		* **α/β Antagonists**\
			* Clonidine
			* Phentolamine, phenoxybenzamine
			* Esmolol
		* **MgSO~4~**\
		Target 2.4-4mmol/L. May also assist in ↓ spasm.


**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
	* **Human antitetanus immunoglobulin**
		* 500 IU
		* Should be given to all patients who are not known to be immunised on presentation
		* Binds circulating toxin
	* Antibiotics\
	Spores and bacteria are destroyed by:
		* Metronidazole 500mg IV Q6-8H for 10 days\
		Preferred.
		* Penicillin G 1-3MU IV Q6H for 10 days
* Procedural
	* Wound care\
	Washout of contaminated wounds.
	* Source control
* Physical


**Supportive Care**:

* C
	* Haemodynamic control
		* Labetalol
		* Magnesium
		* Clonidine
		

**Disposition**:

* ICU


**Preventative**:

* Tetanus toxoid vaccine
	* Cheap
	* Three doses for full course\
	2^nd^ at 6-12 weeks, 3^rd^ at 6-12 months.
	* Booster every 10 years
	* Occasionally results in *local tetanus*\
	Spasm of limb or muscle.
	* Frequent doses may result in non-life threatening immune symptoms


:::column-margin
Neonates have  immunity via maternal antibodies until 3 months, and vaccination of pregnant women will protect children produced within 5 years.

### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies


## Complications

* Death
* B
	* Respiratory failure
* C
	* Cardiac failure\
	↑ Catecholamines.
	* Hypertensive crises
* D
	* Spasm
* F
	* Rhabdomyolysis

## Prognosis

* Death
	* 80% without ICU care
	* 10% with mechanical ventilation
	* More common with:
		* Systemic tetanus
		* Cephalic tetanus\
		Secondary to head and neck injuries with CN involvement.
		* Age
* C
	* Arrhythmias
	* Cardiac failure
* D
	* Spasm
		* Most resolve within 1-3 weeks
		* Residual stiffness may remain
	* Cognitive changes
