# Necrotising Soft Tissue Infections 

Necrotising soft-tissue infections are aggressive, life-threatening infections that:

* Include:
	* Necrotising fasciitis
	* Necrotising myositis
	* Necrotising cellulitis
	* Fournier's Gangrene\
	When involving the perineum.
* Are characterised by rapidly progressing necrosis of subcutaneous tissue and fascia\
Relative sparing of underlying muscle.
* Lead to systemic toxicity with associated multi-organ failure and high mortality\
In absence of this, it may be difficult to differentiate from a severe necrotising abscess or other necrotising soft tissue infection.
* Two subtypes:
	* Polymicrobial necrotising fasciitis (Type 1)
	* Group A Strep necrotising fasciitis (Type 2)


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Predisposing factors for necrotising soft tissue infection include:

* Abnormal anatomy
	* Previous trauma
	* Previous surgery
	* Obesity
	* Lymphedema
	* Chronic venous insufficiency
	* DVT
* Vascular damage
	* PVD
	* Diabetes
	* Smoking
* Immunosuppression
* Route of entry
	* IV drug use
	* Pre-existing infection


Risk factors associated with ↑ mortality include:

* Age\
Especially in >70 age group.
* Illness severity
* Organism\
Higher mortality seen with:
	* Group A Streptococci
	* Enteric organisms

## Pathophysiology

Necrotising fasciitis involves:

* Rapid proliferation of subcutaneous bacteria
* Leukocyte proliferation
* Thrombosis of fascial vessels\
Leads to ischaemia and necrosis of tissue.


Toxic shock syndromes also contribute to haemodynamic instability in both Streptococcal and Staphylococcal infections.


## Clinical Manifestations

Typically present as cellulitis that:

* Fails to improve on antibiotics
* Spreads rapidly across fascial planes
* Has **disproportionate pain** to the degree of injury


Additional features include:

* Fever\
Surprisingly rare.
* Crepitus
Associated with gas-forming organism infection (generally *Clostridia*, classically *C. Perfringens*) but may also occur with other bacteria such as *E. Coli*.

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx



## Investigations



## Management

:::info
Principles:

* Standard sepsis resuscitation
* Aggressive, early, surgical debridement
* Broad spectrum antibiotics with Streptococcal cover
:::

**Resuscitation**:

* C
	* Noradrenaline almost always required in a "true" NSTI

**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
	* **Antimicrobials**
		* Broad-spectrum agent\
			* Amoxacillin/clavulanate 1.2g Q6-8H
			* Meropenem 1g Q8H
		* Streptococcal cover
			* Clindamycin 300-450mg Q6H
		* MRSA cover
			* Vancomycin
	* **IVIg**
		* Associated with ↓ hospital mortality
* Procedural
	* **Aggressive surgical debridement**\
	Improved with surgeon experienced in management.
* Physical
	* **Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy**
		* Controversial
		* Associated with a ↓ in mortality, although evidence is conflicting
		* Use should never delay surgical debridement
		* Significant logistic impediments to use
			* Availability
			* Transfer of critically ill into an isolated environment
		* Evidence is conflicting and some retrospective studies do not demonstrate mortality benefit

Antimicrobial therapy should be adjusted for known resistance patterns.\
\
Clindamycin suppresses Streptococcal toxin production, which may ↓ severity of septic shock.
:::

:::column-margin
The mechanism of HBOT is uncertain, suggestions include:

* ↑ Viability of marginal tissue
* ↓ Bacterial toxin production
* Inhibits anaerobic bacterial growth\
↑ Tissue oxidation reduction potential.
* Potentiates antibiotic function
* ↑ Efficacy of neutrophil respiratory burst
:::


**Disposition**:

* ICU\
Obviously required for shock requiring vasoactive support.


## Complications


## Prognosis

* 30% mortality with aggressive surgical intervention and appropriate antibiotics
* Frequent surgical debridements
* Long hospital stay
* Large soft tissue defects
