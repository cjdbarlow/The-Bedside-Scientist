# Leptospirosis

Acute febrile illness caused by *Leptospira* bacterial species, with a range of clinical presentations from:

* **Mild** influenza-like illness\
Occurs early during the **leptospiraemia phase**, which typically ends after one week as developing antibody response clears bacteraemia.
* **Icteric leptospirosis** (Weil's disease)\
Onset usually at the beginning of the **leptospiruria phase**.
	* Combination of:
		* Acute liver failure
		* Coagulopathy
		* AKI
	* 5-15% mortality
* **Leptospirosis Pulmonary Haemorrhage** Syndrome
	* Respiratory symptoms:
		* Cough
		* Fever
		* Pulmonary haemorrhage
		* ARDS
	* Generally occurs at day 4-6
	* Unrelated to degree of liver dysfunction
	* 30-70% mortality


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Globally important public health disease:

* ↑ With climate change
* Cases relate to:
	* Flooding
	* Rodent-borne transmission
	* Occupational exposure related to agriculture, particularly rice farming
	* Water sports
	* Adventure tourism


## Pathophysiology

*Leptospira* spp. are a family of spirochetes that:

* Infect the PCT
* Are excreted in urine
* Transmitted by exposure to contaminated water or soil

### Aetiology



## Clinical Features

Following a **5-14 day incubation** period:

:::column-margin
![Conjunctival Suffusion](/resources/conj_suffusion.jpg)
:::

* **Leptospiraemia** phase\
Typically lasts **~7 days**.
	* Specific
		* Myalgia
			* Calves
			* Lumbar
		* Conjunctival suffusion\
		Redness without exudate.
	* Non-specific
		* Fever
		* Headache
			* Retro-orbital pain
			* Photophobia
		* Myalgia
		* Vomiting
* A brief **intermission** of 1-3 days
* **Leptospiruria** phase\
Severe disease occurs:
	* Weil's disease
	* Pulmonary haemorrhage syndrome
	* Cardiomyopathy
	* Aseptic Meningitis\
	Rarely.


Uncommon features include:

* Lymphadenopathy
* Hepatosplenomegaly
* Rash


Rarely:

* Meningism


## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

Common differentials:

* Dengue
* Malaria
* Scrub typhus

## Investigations

:::info
Stain poorly with common stains; dark-field microscopic examination of blood, urine, CSF, or other fluids (dialysate!) are diagnostic.
:::

**Bedside**:

**Laboratory**:

* Blood
	* LFTs
	* FBE
		* Variable WCC
		* Thrombocytopenia in severe disease
	* Cultures\
	During the first **few days** of disease, whilst **leptospiraemia** persists. May take up to 14 days to develop.
	* Microscopic Agglutination Testing\
	Diagnostic at 5-7 days. Logistically laborious.
	* DNA PCR\
	Diagnostic, limited by access.
* Urine
	* Proteinuria
	* Pyuria
	* Microscopic haematuria
	* Cultures\
	During the first **week**, during **leptospiruria** phase.
* CSF
	* Leukocytosis
	* ↑ Protein
	* Normal glucose


**Imaging**:

**Other**:

## Management

**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
	* Antimicrobials
		* 1^st^ line: Benzylpenicillin
		* 2^nd^ line:
			* Ceftriaxone
			* Doxycycline
* Procedural
* Physical

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:

**Preventative**:


### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

## Anaesthetic Considerations

## Complications

* Death
* F
	* AKI
* I
	* Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction\
	Transient acute inflammatory reaction due to release of bacterial toxin and cytokines due to rapid genocide of spirochetes, and can lead to distributive shock, high fever (38-41°C) and occasionally DIC.
