# Clostridium Difficile

Infective diarrhoea that may lead to pseudomembranous colitis, occurring secondary to:

* Broad-spectrum antibiotics
* Chemotherapy

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Antibiotic-associated *C. difficile* infection:

* Causes :
	* 10-25% of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea
	* Almost all cases of pseudomembranous colitis
* Is most commonly associated with:
	* Clindamycin
	* Cephalosporins
	* Fluoroquinolones


## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

## Clinical Manifestations

Two clinical pictures:

* Diarrhoea with associated fever
* Ileus (and no diarrhoea) with leukocytosis and toxic megacolon

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

**Bedside**:

**Laboratory**:

* Blood
	* FBE
		* Leukocytosis
	* LFT
		* Hypoalbuminaemia
* Stool
	* Antigen and toxin\
	Sensitive, persist after resolution of infection.
	* Culture
		* 2-3 days to grow
		* Technically demanding
		* Most useful for epidemiological purposes for strain typing

**Laboratory**:

**Other**:

* Proctoscopy/flexible sigmoidoscopy
	* Facilitates direct visualisation of pseudomembranes
	* Method to detect severe disease
	* Risk of perforation limits use
	* Role in severe disease and antigen and toxin tests are negative or unavailable

## Management

**Resuscitation**:\

ABC approach. Comment on team coordination and clinical priorities.
**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
* Procedural
* Physical

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:

**Preventative**:


### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

## Anaesthetic Considerations

## Complications

## Prognosis

## Key Studies
