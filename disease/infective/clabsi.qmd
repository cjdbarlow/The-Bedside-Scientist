# CLABSI

Confirmation of central-line associated bloodstream infections requires all of:

* Laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infection
* Central line was in place for over 48 hours prior to the confirmation
* Organism cultured from blood is not related to another infection

:::column-margin
The CLABSI rate is a marker of ICU function, and is reported as number of infections per 1000 central line-days.

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Invasive lines are a major cause of nosocomial infections, causing ~65% of bloodstream infections. Risks depend on:

* Duration of line insertion
* Site
	* Femoral possibly highest risk
	* Subclavian possibly lowest risk
* Line features
	* Non-antimicrobial coated
	* Number of lumens
	* Frequency of access
	* Overly frequent or infrequent dressing changes
* Type of line\
In descending order:
	* PA catheter\
	3.7/1000 line-days.
	* Non-tunneled CVC\
	2.7/1000 line-days.
	* Arterial line\
	1.7/1000 line-days.
	* Tunneled CVC
	1.6/1000 line-days.
	* PICC line
	1.1/1000 line-days.
	* Peripheral IVC
	0.5/1000 line-days.
	* Midline
	0.2/1000 line-days.
* Colonisation\
Occurs in 5-40% of catheters. Colonisation is a risk factor for infection, but is otherwise of no consequence.


## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

Causative organisms:

* Predominantly match patient endogenous flora
* Commonly are coagulase negative *Staph* spp.\

## Management

**Resuscitation**:

ABC approach. Comment on team coordination and clinical priorities.
**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
	* Antimicrobials\
	Agent and duration depends on causative organism:
		* Coagulase-negative *Staphylococcus*: 5 days
		* *S. Aureus*: 14 days
		* *Candida*: 14 days
* Procedural
	* Remove line
* Physical

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:

**Preventative**:

* Rationalise insertion
* Antibiotic coated lines for immunocompromised patients
* Aseptic insertion and management
	* Policy around insertion
	* Securing of line to prevent tract inoculation
	* Sterile line dressings
	* Daily line inspection
	* 7-daily dressing changes
* Dedicated lumen for lipid infusions

Routine changing of lines based solely on catheter-days is not indicated.
