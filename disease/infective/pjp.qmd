# Pneumocystis Jirovecii Pneumonia

:::info
*Pneumocystis jirovecii* was previously known as *Pneumocystis carinii*, and was also classified as a protozoan and not a fungus.

It is therefore sometimes still referred to by the "PCP" acronym.
:::

Severe fungal pneumonia caused the PJP organism, which is essentially confined to the severely immunocompromised:

* HIV
* Transplant recipients
* Haematological malignancy

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

## Clinical Manifestations

Usually insidious:

* Non-productive cough
* Dyspnoea
* Fever
* Fatigue
* Weight loss
* Crepitations are **rare**

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

* Alternative diagnosis for respiratory failure is present in ~15%

## Investigations

Bloods:

* ↑ LDH\
Common, non-specific.


Radiology:

* CXR
    * Normal in 10%
    * Perihilar and interstitial shadowing\
    Often subtle and missed.
    

Sputum:

Organisms **persist** for days or weeks, so unlike many other infections, treatment can start prior to sampling if diagnostic suspicion is high enough.
:::

* Adequate non-invasive sampling requires **induced sputum**
    * Hypertonic saline nebuliser provokes bronchorrhoea and extensive coughing
    * Time consuming
    * Requires good operator skill
* Bronchoscopy with BAL\
Diagnostic in >90%.   

## Management

**Resuscitation**:\

ABC approach. Comment on team coordination and clinical priorities.
**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
    * Antimicrobials
        * Trimethoprim/Sulphamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole) 20+100mg/kg daily for 3 weeks\
        ↓ By 25% if WCC falls.
        * Pentamidine 4mg/kg IV daily\
        If cotrimoxazole not tolerated.
    * Corticosteroids\
    For patients with HIV infection.
        * Prednisolone
            * 40mg BD for 5 days
            * 20mg BD for 5 days
            * 20mg daily until antibiotic treatment completed
* Physical
* Procedural
