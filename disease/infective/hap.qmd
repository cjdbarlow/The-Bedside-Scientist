# Hospital/Ventilator Acquired Pneumonia

Pneumonia (infection with chest infiltrate) occuring 48 hours after:

* Hospital admission (HAP)
* Intubation (VAP)

:::column-margin
Clinical signs of respiratory infection without CXR infiltrates are suggestive of tracheobronchitis.
:::

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

HAP:

* Occurs in 0.5-5% of inpatients
* Risk is ↑ if:
    * Post-operative
    * In ICU


## Pathophysiology

Microaspiration of organisms colonising the upper respiratory tract.

### Aetiology

## Clinical Manifestations

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

Blood:

* FBE\
WCC may ↑ or ↓.
* Procalcitonin\
May have a role in timing deescalation of antibiotics.
* Blood cultures

Sputum:

* More complex in the intubated patient
* Options include:
    * Tracheal aspirate\
    Identify potentially causative organisms but is not quantitative.
    * Bronchial washings
    * Bronchoalveolar Lavage


Radiology:

* CXR\
    * Infiltrates required for diagnosis is many guidelines
    * Appearance usually worsens in initial period, even with institution of appropriate antibiotics\
    Features of concern are:
        * Cavitation
        * Pleural effusion
    * Radiographic improvement lags behind clinical response

## Management

**Resuscitation**:\

* A
    * Intubation may be required
* B
    * Supplmental oxygen
* C
    * Haemodynamic support if concurrent sepsis 


**Specific therapy**:

:::column-margin

Risk factors for MDR include:

* Disease
    * Immunosupression
    * Bronchiectasis
    * Septic shock
    * ARDS
* Treatment
    * Prior IV ABx in previous 90 days
    * Hospitalisation >5 days
    * RRT
* Environmental
    * High local MDR burden 
:::

* Antimicrobial therapy\
    * **7 day course** recommended to reduce subsequent MDR pneumonias.
    * 2-3 days until clinical response seen is usual
    * If **failing to respond**, consider:
        * Wrong bug\
        Repeat cultures.
        * Wrong drug\
        Ensure sensitivity of organism to the antibiotic beingused.
        * Wrong dose\
        Appropirate for patient weight.
        * Sequestration\
        Abscess cavity or similar
        * Patient factors
            * Immunosuppression
            * Frailty
    * No MDR risk factors\
    Consider:
        * Tazocin 4.5g Q6-8H
        * Cefepime 2g Q8H
        * Meropenem 1g Q8H
    * MDR risk factors\
    Consider one of each of:
        * Antipseudomonal broad spectrum agent\
        As above.
        * Additional gram negative cover\
        ↓ Risk that pathogen is resistant to the primary agent.
            * Aminoglycoside 15-20mg Q24H
            * Ciprofloxacin 400mg Q8H
            * Levofloxacin 750mg Q24H
        * MRSA cover:
            * Linezolid 600mg Q12H
            * Vancomycin 
              

**Prevention**:

* A
    * Nurse 30° head up to ↓ risk of microaspiration
    * Oral care Q4H with chlorhexidine mouthwash BD
    * Use subglottic suctioning
    * Use closed suction circuits
    * Avoid non-essential suctioning
    * Minimise changes of ventilation equipment
        * Suction cathethers
        * Humidifiers
        * Circuit
* B
    * Minimise duration of mechanical ventilation
* E
    * Early mobilisation 

### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies


## Complications

* Death\
Attributable mortality is low.
* ↑ Ventilator days and ICU length of stay
* Parapneumonic effusion
    * Uncomplicated effusions resolve with resolution of the underlying infection
    * Complex effusions:
        * Develop 1-2 weeks after the initial fluid collection
        * May occur with persistent fevers and have organisms on Gram stain\
        Essentially empyema-lite.
* Empyema\
Collection of pus in the pleural space, usually evolving from a parapneumonic effusion. Antibiotics are adjunctive, and these require drainage either:
    * Percutaneous\
    First-line therapy, but difficult to effectively drain extensively loculated collections.
    * Surgical\
    Open or VATS drainage is the most effetive tool.
