# Aspergillosis

Fungal infection by the ***Aspergillus*** mould family with a broad **spectrum** of clinical **disease** from:

* **Hypersensitivity**\
Colonisation is usually benign, but allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis can result and progress to:
    * Asthma
    * Bronchiectasis
    * Pulmonary fibrosis
* **Aspergilloma**
* **Necrotising pneumonia**
* **Invasive aspergillosis**\
Severe respiratory failure, usually with different preceding course depending on immune function.
    * **Neutropenic**\
    Refractory fever, extra-pulmonary infection (abscesses), and pulmonary infarction.
    * **Non-neutropenic**\
    Mimics bacterial pneumonia with dyspnoea and sputum production predominating.


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Major risk factors for both disease and severity are essentially **surrogates of immunosuppression** as well as underlying **lung disease**. They include:

:::column-margin
Respiratory disease significantly ↑ rate of aspergillus colonisation, and risk of subsequent infection if immunocompromise occurs.
:::

* **Patient**
    * Extremes of age\
    \<1 and >70.
    * Malnutrition
    * Alcohol misuse
* **Disease**
    * Respiratory
        * COPD
        * CF
        * Interstitial lung disease
    * Immunocompromise
        * Diabetes
        * Burns
        * HIV
        * Prolonged neutropenia
        * Bone marrow transplant
        * Solid organ transplant\
        Lung most significant.
        * Complicated abdominal surgery
        * Decompensated CLD
* **Treatment factors**
    * Prolonged ICU stay
    * Mechanical ventilation
    * Broad spectrum antibiotics
    * Indwelling catheters
    * PN
    * Steroid\
    \>1mg/kg for >2 weeks.
    * Chemotherapy
* **Environmental**
    * Construction site exposure 

## Pathophysiology

Fungal pneumonia:

* Peri-vascular predominance in the immunocompromised
    * ↑ Rate of pulmonary infarction\
    Leads to:
        * Haemoptysis
        * Cavity formation
* Bronchoalveolar pneumonia in the immunocompetent
    * Similar to other pneumonias
    * "Classical" features of cavitation and aspergilloma formation are rarer


## Clinical Manifestations

The majority of cases are secondary mycoses of the immunosuppressed, although can occur in otherwise immunocompetent patients with intercurrent illness.

Features include:

* Respiratory failure
    * Resting hypoxaemia
* Persistent infection
    * Pneumonia refractory to antibiotics
    * Refractory fever
* Pulmonary infarction
    * Cough
    * Pleuritic chest pain
    * Haemoptysis\
    May be massive.
    * Pneumothorax\
    Rare.
* Distant infection
    * Abscesses
    * Skin lesions


In the immunocompromised, haematogenous dissemination and rampant infection can lead to:

* Endocarditis
* Endophthalmitis
* Abscesses

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx


## Investigations

:::info
Cultures, stain, and specific testing (galactomannan, PCR) are unable to discriminate between colonisation and infection.
:::

**Laboratory**:

:::column-margin
Galactomannan is a cell wall polysaccharide found in *aspergillus*, ice cream, salad dressings, and cream cheese. 
:::

* Blood
    * FBE
        * Eosinophilia
        * Neutropenia
    * Serum galactomannan
        * Moderately sensitive (75%) and specific (85%) at a cutoff of >0.5\
        Higher cutoffs ↑ specificity and ↓ sensitivity.
        * Lower sensitivity in the immunocompetent and those receiving prophylaxis
    * β-D-glucan antigen\
    Cell wall component of most fungi. Improves sensitivity and specificity in combination with galactomannan.
    * Serum PCR\
    Similar diagnostic properties to serum galactomannan.
* Bronchoscopy\
BAL is an integral part of adequate sampling.
    * Visual inspection
    * Fungal culture and stain\
        * Difficult to culture, with correspondingly low sensitivity and long culture times
        * Loss of specificity with *aspergillus* colonisation
    * *Aspergillus* PCR
        * Highly sensitive - negative result persuasive for no infection
    * BAL galactomannan
        * Better than serum galactomannan in the immunocompetent\
        More likely to have contained pulmonary disease.
    * Transbronchial biopsy
        * Definitive diagnostic test
        * Risk of bleeding and pneumothorax often precludes this, particularly in the critically unwell
* Sputum\
Significantly ↓ yield compared with BAL.
    * *Aspergillus* radioallergosorbent assay
    * Silver staining
    * *Aspergillus* IgG/IgE

**Imaging**:

* **CXR**
    * Aspergilloma cavities
* **CT**
    * Aspergilloma cavities
    * Nodules
    * Monod sign\
    Free-moving (i.e. positional and dependent) aspergilloma in a pulmonary cavity.
    * Halo sign\
    Ground-glass opacity around a nodule or mass, usually indicating haemorrhage secondary to pulmonary infarction.
    * Air crescent sign\
    Halo of air around a region of necrosis, and indicates recovery.

**Other**:

* Open lung biopsy\
Rarely indicated due to risk of procedure.

## Management

:::info
Aggressiveness of antifungal treatment depends on the severity of clinical presentation, and usually begins prior to diagnostic confirmation due to the long lead time of specific investigations.
:::


**Resuscitation**:\

**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
    * Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis
        * Corticosteroids
        * PO itraconazole
    * Aspergilloma
        * PO itraconazole
    * Pneumonia and invasive disease
        * **IV antifungal**
            * **Voriconazole**\
            1^st^ line for efficacy.
            * **Echinocandins**\
            Synergistic when combined with azoles. Combination therapy may be appropriate with:
                * Known or likely azole resistance\
                From culture findings, treatment failure, or local microbial patterns.
                * Severe disease\
                Profound immunosuppression.
            * Amphotericin B\
            Generally not preferred due to nephrotoxicity. Indicated for:
                * Hepatic failure
                * Azole-resistant
        * **Altering immunosuppression**\
        Consideration should be given to ↓ exogenous immunosuppression.
        * **G-CSF**\
        For neutropenia.
* Procedural
    * Aspergilloma
        * **Surgical resection**
        * Percutaneous amphotericin injection
* Physical
    * Respiratory isolation

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:
