# Candidiasis

Systemic candidal infections are common in the immunocompromised and intensive care patients. Differentiating invasive candidiasis from culture of a normal commensal requires any of:

:::column-margin
Candidal infections also include the more pedestrian mucous membrane infections of the systemically well, which are caused by local overgrowth of yeast and respond well to topical treatment.\
\
These are not covered here.
:::

* Culture from a sterile site
	* Blood\
	⩾2 non-contiguous sites.
* Culture from wound or burn site
* Cultured species is non-commensal


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Risk factors:

* ICU admission
	* Immunocompromise
		* Transplant
		* Haematological malignancy
		* Diabetes
* For non-*Albicans*
	* **TPN**
	* Central access
	* Antimicrobial exposure:
		* Broad spectrum antibiotics
		* Fluconazole
	* Malignancy
	* Renal failure

## Pathophysiology

Candida is:

* A genus of yeasts\
Over 100 different species, ~20 of which are pathogens.
* Part of the normal skin and gut flora



### Aetiology

Causes have been classically divided on epidemiological and fluconazole-sensitive grounds into:

:::column-margin
The ongoing utility of this classification is questionable as the non-Albicans infections have become increasingly common, and *albicans* has become increasingly resistant to fluconazole.
::: 

* *C. Albicans*\
~50% of all infections.
* Non-Albicans infections\
All the rest:
	* ***C. Auris***\
	Multi-drug resistant form.
	* *C. glabrata*
	* *C. krusei*
	* *C. parapsilosis*
	* *C. dubliniensis*
	* *C. tropicalis*


## Clinical Manifestations

Features are non-specific and include:

* Fever\
Generally unreliable, though may be high with hepatosplenic abscesses.
* Sepsis\
Non-responsive to other antimicrobial therapy.

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx


## Investigations

Bedside:

Laboratory:

* Blood
	* Blood cultures
* Sputum
	* Bronchoalveolar lavage
* Other fluid culture

Imaging:

Other:

## Management

**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
	* **Antifungal**
		* **Echinocandin** as initial therapy
		* Fluconazole as step-down therapy\
		If sensitivity is proven.
	* ↓ Immunosuppressants
* Procedural
	* Source control
	* Remove lines and devices


**Supportive care**:

* G
	* Adequate nutrition


### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

## Anaesthetic Considerations

## Complications

Disseminated Candida causes a large number of organ-specific complications:

* B
	* Pulmonary candidiasis\
	Cavitating lung lesions.
* C
	* Endocarditis
		* Very high mortality
* D
	* Endophthalmitis\
	3-15 days following infection.
* E
	* Candidal joint infections
	* Skin lesions
	* Muscle abscesses
* G
	* Hepatic abscess
* H
	* Splenic abscess

## Prognosis

Mortality in the ICU patient is up to 50%.
