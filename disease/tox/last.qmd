# Local Anaesthetic Systemic Toxicity


> This is an <span style="color:red">**anaesthetic crisis**</span>  
> Priority is to:
>* **Maintain oxygenation**
>* **Control seizures**
>* **Manage arrhythmias or CVS arrest**
>* **Give intravenous lipid emulsion**


Excessive systemic levels of local anaesthetic. LAST presents:

* With CNS or CVS signs  
Up to and including seizures and **cardiac arrest**.
* Variably  
Presentation may be:
	* In PACU, the ward, or after hospital discharge
	* Obscured by other perioperative events

##<span style="color:red">Emergency Management</span>

Priorities:
1. Cease LA injection
2. Call for help  
**Early** consideration of CPB or **ECMO**, if available.
3. Support physiology  
Maintain oxygenation and ventilation, and consider intubation.
4. **Intralipid emulsion**


Specific management:

* Control seizures  
	* Benzodiazepine preferred
	* Propofol reasonable alternative  
	Note potential haemodynamic instability.
* Arrhythmia
	* Start ALS if required  
	Consider ECMO.
	* Reduce dose adrenaline  
	⩽1μg/kg.
	* **Avoid**:
		* Vasopressin
		* Calcium-channel blockers
		* β-blockade
7. Give **intravenous lipid emulsion**
	* **1.5mL/kg bolus**  
	Repeat if unstable.
	* Commence infusion at **15mL/kg/hr**  
	Double rate if unstable.
	* Up to **12ml/kg total** volume.
	* Continue at least **15 minutes after haemodynamic stability** achieved.


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

LAST:

* Occurs in ~1/1,000-1/10,000 regional techniques
	* Cardiac arrest in ~1/25,000
* Associated with:
	* Upper limb and PVB blockade
	* ↑ LA dose
	* Reduced patient body weight
	* Use of lignocaine
* Protective factors
	* Use of ultrasound

## Management

### Preventative Management

* Use the lowest effective dose of LA required
* Use ultrasound
* Monitor LA spread during injection
	* If not seen, suggests intravascular injection
* Consider use of adrenaline in the block  
Gives a marker for inadvertent intravascular injection.
