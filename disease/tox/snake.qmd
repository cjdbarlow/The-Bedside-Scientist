# Snakebite


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors


## Pathophysiology

Venoms are complex protein mixtures that act as toxins via one or more of these effects:

* **Neurotoxins**\
Pre- and post-synaptic neuromuscular blockade
	* Post-synaptic blockade reversible with antivenom
	* Pre-synaptic blockade may not be reversible
* **Prothrombin** activators
	* Leads to:
		* Consumptive coagulopathy
		* MAHA
		* Cardiovascular collapse\
		Likely due to idiosyncratic pulmonary hypertension or PE.
	* Requires antivenom
* **Anticoagulants**\
Prevents clotting without consumption.
* **Rhabdomyolysins**
	* Direct muscle damage
	* AKI

: Clinical Manifestations by Time Course

:::column-margin
Disease may occur progress much more rapidly in children.
:::


## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

Identification of the snake is helpful but not essential:

* Venom detection kid should be used to guide antivenom selection
* Antivenom should be used to cover snakes in that geographical region

## Investigations

**Bedside**:

**Laboratory**:

* Venom detection kit\
Performed on blood, urine, or other tissue.
	* Highly sensitive
	* ~25 minutes to run
	* **Very high venom** concentration may **cause** a **false negative**\
	Dilute sample and run again if that possiblity exists.

**Imaging**:

**Other**:

## Management

:::priority
* **Pressure-immobilisation bandage**
* **Antivenom**
* Resuscitation as required
:::

**Resuscitation**:

:::column-margin
The **pressure-immobilisation bandage** is designed to ↓ lymphatic and capillary absorption. It is **not** an arterial **torniquet**.
:::

* **Pressure-immobilisation bandage**
	* Crepe bandage applied from digits up the limb as far as possible, including the bite site
	* Further immobilisation applied to restrict joints on either side
	* ↓ Absorption by lymphatics by:
		* ↑ Hydrostatic pressure
		* ↓ Skeletal muscle pump
	* Should only be removed once antivenom administered
	* Should not be removed for sampling\
	Cut a window over the bite site to sample.
	* Should be reapplied if the patient deteriorates
* A
	* Intubation if required
* B
	* Supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation as required
* C
	* Fluid resuscitation as required

**Specific therapy**:

:::column-margin
In general, the dose is two vials. Dosing is reasonably crude and based mostly on trials in small, cute animals.
:::

* Pharmacological
	* **Antivenom**\
		* 2-3× dose should be given if critically unwell
		* Can be withheld if clinical situation is mild
		* High risk of immediate hypersensitivity (25%) including **anaphylaxis (10%!)**
		* **Premedication** with **subcutaneous adrenaline** is recommended:
			* 0.01mg/kg in children
			* 0.25mg in adults
		* Administer over 15-30 minutes if situation permits
	* Antibiotics\
	Consider for contaminated wounds.
* Procedural
* Physical

**Supportive care**:

:::column-margin
Antivenom will reverse anticoagulant effects, but not replace lost clotting factors.
:::

* D
	* Analgesia\
	Particularly if rhabdomyolysis.
* F
	* AKI prevention
		* Aim 1-2mL/kg/hr of urine output
	* Electrolyte derangement\
	Rhabdomyolysis.
* H
	* Coagulopathy treatment

**Disposition**:

* Observe for at least 12 hours

**Preventative**:


### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

* Heparin\
Not recommended in procoagulant coagulopathy (or for anything else).

## Anaesthetic Considerations

## Complications

* Death
* D
	* Persistent neurological sequelae:
		* Diplopia
		* Anosmia
	* PTSD
* F
	* CKD

## Prognosis

Death is:

* Due to:
	* Respiratory paralysis
	* Cardiac arrest
	* AKI
	* Haemorrhage
* Relatively rare:
	* Untreated ~2%
	* Treated ~0.1%

Poor prognostic signs:

* Massive envenomation
* Remove location
* Out of hospital collapse
* Inadequate antivenom therapy
