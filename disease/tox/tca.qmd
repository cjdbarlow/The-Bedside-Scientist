# Tricyclic Antidepressants

Present with features of:

* **Sodium channel blockade**
	* Broad complex **arrhythmia**
* **Anticholinergic toxicity**
	* Tachycardia
	* Mydriasis
	* Dry mouth and skin
	* Urinary retention
* **α-blockade**
	* Hypotension
* **↓ Catecholamine reuptake**\
Initial ↑ sympathetic tone with hypertension followed by prolonged decreased tone and hypotension.


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

* Leading cause of death from overdose patients arriving alive at ED
* 50% of all ICU overdose admissions

## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

## Clinical Features



## Assessment

**History**:

* Dose
	* 10mg/kg is potentially life threatening
	* 30mg/kg associated with pH dependent toxicity and coma for >24 hours
* Timing\
Asymptomatic window for up to 6 hours.

**Exam**:

### Investigations

**Bedside**:

* ECG
	* Sodium channel blockade
		* PR prolongation
		* **QRS >100ms**\
		Due to IV conduction delay. Risk of VT (and seizures) ↑ with ↑ QRS width.
		* **Terminal R wave >3mm** in **aVR**\
		↑ Susceptibility of the right IV conducting system to Na^+^-channel blockade, causing terminal right axis deviation.
	* Anticholinergic
		* **Sinus tachycardia**
	* Malignant arrhythmias

**Laboratory**:

**Imaging**:

**Other**:

### Diagnostic Approach and DDx


## Management

:::priority
* **Activated charcoal**
* Treat **arrhythmias** and **seizures**
* **Induce alkalosis** with sodium bicarbonate
* **Normalise physiology**\
Hypothermia, acidosis, and hypotension all ↑ toxicity.
:::

**Resuscitation**:

* C
	* Fluid resuscitation
	* Antiarrhythmics
		* Avoid class 1a agents as they worsen sodium channel blockade
		* Lignocaine preferable
* D
	* Seizure control\
	May need intubation and propofol infusion.
* F
	* Induce alkalosis\
	↑ Unionised portion of drug (pKa 8.4) which ↑ distribution into peripheral compartments and away from heart.
		* Sodium bicarbonate\
		Preferable as ↑ Na^+^ overcomes Na^+^-channel blockade.
		* Hyperventilation


**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
	* Activated charcoal\
	Multi-dose.
* Procedural
* Physical

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:

**Preventative**:
