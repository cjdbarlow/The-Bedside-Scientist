# Carbon Monoxide

Carbon monoxide is a toxic gas that has **high affinity** for haemoglobin, displacing oxygen from haemoglobin binding sites resulting in a significant fall in blood oxygen carrying capacity and cellular hypoxia.

Carbon monoxide is also:

* Odourless
* Colourless
* Less dense than air
* Flammable

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

Carbon monoxide:

* Has **240 times** the **affinity** for **haemoglobin** than oxygen
* Has a half-life of ~320 minutes breathing air
	* ↓ To 75 minutes on 100% O~2~

### Aetiology

## Clinical Manifestations

Symptoms vary with the proportion of COHb:

* Mild (10-25%)
	* Weakness
	* Dizziness
	* Confusion
* Moderate (25-40%)
	* Nausea
	* Arrhythmia
* Severe (>40%)
	* Coma → Seizure

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

## Management

**Resuscitation**:

* A
	* Intubation indicated if no longer protecting airway
* B
	* Supplemental oxygen

**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
* Procedural
* Physical

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:

**Preventative**:
