# Paracetamol {#sec-pmolod}

Paracetamol toxicity causes **acute liver injury** due to **↑ levels** of its **toxic metabolite NAPQI** due to **failure** of **conjugation** with **glutathione**. This can occur due to either:

* **↑ NAPQI production**, **exhausting** normal **glutathione** levels\
Paracetamol overdose.
* **↓ Glutathione levels**, ↑ vulnerability to paracetamol in normal doses\
Malnutrition.


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

Paracetamol is metabolised by two pathways:

* Conjugation with glucuronide sulfates\
Normal metabolic pathway (~95% of a therapeutic dose) that produces non-toxic metabolites which are renally cleared.
* CYP450 2E1 to NAPQI
	* Minor metabolic pathway under normal circumstances
	* Produces hepatotoxic NAPQI
	* NAPQI is conjugated with hepatic glutathione to non-toxic metabolites which are renally cleared
	* Absence of glutathione leads to accumulation of NAPQI
	* NAPQI covalently binds multiple proteins, leading to uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation and hepatic cell death

## Clinical Features

:::caution
Often asymptomatic in the first 24-48 hours; may then develop liver failure.
:::

Gastrointestinal:

* Abdominal pain
* Nausea
* Vomiting

Severe toxicity:

* Coma
* Lactic metabolic acidosis

## Assessment

**History**:

* Dose
* Formulation ingested
* Timing
	* Single ingestion
	* Staggered ingestion
	* Repeated ingestion

## Management

:::priority
* **Activated charcoal**
* **NAC**
* **Liver transplant** if fulminant hepatic failure
:::

**Resuscitation**:\

**Specific therapy**:

:::column-margin
![Prescottt Nomogram](/resources/prescott.png)
:::

* Pharmacological
	* **Activated charcoal**\
	Appropriate if:
		* Immediate release within 2 hours
		* Modified release within 4 hours
	* **N-acetylcysteine** (NAC)\
	Stimulates glutathione stimulus, allowing NAPQI to be conjugated.
		* Prescott nomogram indicates when NAC therapy should be given\
			* \>200mg/kg or 10g in a one-off ingestion should receive NAC independent of level
			* Inaccurate in sustained-release preparations; therefore NAC should be given empirically
		* Early administration results in significant reduction in mortality (to <1%), though even late administration may improve outcome.
		* 150mg/kg load over 15-60 minutes
		* 50mg/kg over 4 hours
		* 100mg/kg over 16 hours
		* Further doses may be indicated (usually 150mg/kg over 24 hours)
		* NAC may be ceased after 24 hours if:
			* Paracetamol concentration <10mg/L
			* ALT <50U/L
			* INR <2
			* Clinically well
* Procedural
	* **Liver transplant**\
	Referral indicated for:
		* SBP <80mmHg
		* Hypoglycaemia
		* Encephalopathy
		* pH <7.3 following resuscitation
		* Oliguria
		* Creatinine >200μmol/L
		* INR >4.5
		* INR >3 for 48 hours
* Physical


:::column-margin
If in doubt, give NAC.

## Prognosis

Severe hepatic injujry has ~10% mortality.
