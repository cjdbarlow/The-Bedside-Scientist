# Digoxin

Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside that inhibits the Na^+^-K^+^-ATPase pump. Toxicity may be:

* **Cardiac**\
Typically tachyarrhythmias with ↓ AV nodal conduction, and may be life-threatening.
* **Non-cardiac**\
May cause hyperkalaemia and yellow vision, in addition to more general symptoms such as confusion and GI upset.
* **Chronic**\
Due to progressive accumulation. Most common presentation, and has high mortality (15-30%). Due to:
	* Too high a daily dose
	* ↓ Renal function with unchanged dose
	* Drug interactions
* **Acute**\
From a large single ingestion:
	* Toxicity: 2mg
	* Fatal:
		* Adult: >10mg
		* Children: ~4mg

Adverse effects may be delayed by several hours.

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

Drug interactions:

* ↓ Clearance
	* Amiodarone
	* Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers
* ↑ Absorption
	* Macrolides\
	Kill gut bacteria which may digest some of the absorbed dose.
	* PPI\
	↑ Permeability.

## Clinical Features

Cardiac:

:::column-margin
The tachyarrhythmias are essentially any that don't rely on AV conduction.
:::

* **↓ HR** and **heart block** due to slowing of AV nodal conduction
* ↑ **Automaticity**\
General ↑ in rate of discharge of pacemaker cells, causing a variety of tachyarrhythmias:
	* AF
	* Flutter\
	With low ventricular rate due to AV block.
	* Ventricular ectopics
	* VF
	* VT


Non-cardiac:

* **Xanthopsia**\
Yellow bias of colour perception.
* **Hyperkalaemia**\
Due to inhibition of the Na^+^-K^+^-ATPase in cardiac and skeletal muscle.
* GI symptoms\
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain.
* Confusion

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

**Bedside**:

* ABG/VBG
	* Potassium level
* ECG

**Laboratory**:

* Blood
	* Serum digoxin level
	* UEC
		* Glucose

**Imaging**:

**Other**:

## Management

:::priority
* Manage **arrhythmia**
* **Correct electrolytes** and acidosis\
Toxicity is exacerbated by hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypocalcaemia, and acidosis.
* Give **digoxin-specific antibody**
:::

**Resuscitation**:

* C
	* ↓ HR
		* Atropine
		* Adrenaline
		* Pacing\
		Rarely effective.
	* ↑ HR
		* Magnesium
		* Lignocaine
* F
	* Electrolytes
		* Hyperkalaemia
			* Insulin-dextrose as first line
			* Correct to high-normal
		* Hypomagnesaemia
		* Hypocalcaemia
	* Acidosis


**Specific therapy**:

:::column-margin
Serum digoxin levels cannot be accurately measured for ~3 weeks after digoxin antibody as the assay will measure bound digoxin.
:::

* Pharmacological
	* **Digoxin-specific antibody fragments**\
	Indicated for:
		* Cardiac arrest
		* Life-threatening arrhythmia
		* Lethal dose ingestion
		* Persistent hyperkalaemia or arrhythmia
		* Serum level >12ng/mL
	* Activated charcoal\
	Multiple doses to interrupt enterohepatic recirculation.
* Procedural
* Physical

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:

**Preventative**:
