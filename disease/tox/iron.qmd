# Iron

Iron toxicity and classically occurs over **four phases**:

* **Phase 1**: 0-6 hours\
Mucosal corrosion with consequent GI symptoms.
* **Phase 2**: 6-12 hours\
Asymptomatic phase as iron shifts intracellularly.
* **Phase 3**: 12-48 hours\
Systemic iron toxicity.
	* Distributive shock
	* HAGMA
	* Renal failure
	* Hepatic failure\
	Risk extends out to 5 days.
* **Phase 4**: 2-6 weeks\
Chronic GI strictures.



## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

## Clinical Manifestations

Phase 1:

* Nasuea
* Vomiting
* Haematemesis
* Diarrhoea
* Melaena

Phase 3:

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

Risk assessment is based on the amount of **elemental iron** ingested:

* Function of the:
	* *Elemental* iron content of the tablet\
		* Varies depending if the tablet contains ferrous or ferric iron, and anion it is bound to
		* Check the label
	* Number of tablets
		* History
		* Abdominal XR
* In general:
	* Asymptomatic: <20mg/kg
	* GI symptoms: 20-60mg/kg
	* Systemic: 60-120mg/kg
	* Lethal: >120mg/kg

:::column-margin
The dose is divided by a constant to get the proportion of elemental iron in the tablet:

* Ferrous Sulfate (Dried): Dose/3.3
* Ferrous Sulfate (Heptahydrate): Dose/5
* Ferrous Gluconate: Dose/9
* Ferous Fumarate: Dose/3
* Ferric Chloride: Dose/3.5
* Ferrous Chloride: Dose/4
:::

## Investigations

**Bedside**:

* ABG
	* HAGMA

**Laboratory**:

* Blood
	* Serum iron\
	Levels do not correlate with toxicity, but >90μmol/L is predictive of systemic toxicity.
		* Peak 4-6 hours following ingestion
			* ↓ Afterwards as iron moves intracellularly
	* Coag
	* UEC
	* LFT

**Imaging**:

* AXR
	* Confirm ingestion

**Other**:

## Management

**Resuscitation**:

* C
	* Fluid resuscitation
		* GI losses
		* Distributive shock

**Specific therapy**:

:::column-margin
Maximal licensed dose of desferioxamine is 80mg/kg/day, though severe toxicity will generally require more than this.
:::

* Pharmacological
	* **Desferioxamine**
		* Chelates free iron ions in plasma, the water soluble complex is renally cleared
		* If shock, HAGMA, altered mental state, or ↑ serum level
		* 15mg/kg/hr up to 40mg/kg/hr for severe toxicity
		* Requires cardiac monitoring due to risk of hypotension
		* Ceased when clinical stabile and serum ion <60μmol/L
* Procedural
* Physical
	* **Whole bowel irrigation**\
	For all confirmed ingestions.
	* **Endoscopic removal**\
	If WBI not feasible or potentially lethal ingestion.

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:

* If asymptomatic at 6 hours with a negative XR may be discharged
* Symptomatic patients should be admitted

**Preventative**:
