# Toxic Alcohols {#sec-tox_etoh}

Toxic alcohols are relatively benign in themselves but produce highly **toxic metabolites** that cause **neurotoxicity** as well as other organ-specific toxicities. Toxic alcohols include:

* **Methanol**\
	* Found in de-icers, windshield wiper fluid, antifreeze, paint strippers, embalming fluid
	* Metabolised to formaldehyde and then to **formic acid**\
	HAGMA and ocular toxicity in addition to neurotoxicity.
* **Ethylene glycol**
	* Found in antifreeze, degreasers, and metal cleaners
	* Metabolised in a series of steps to **oxalic acid**\
	HAGMA, cardiopulmonary toxicity, and nephrotoxicity in addition to neurotoxicity.
* **Isopropanol**
	* Found in rubbing alcohol, hand sanitiser, and other antiseptics
	* Metabolised to **acetone** and so does *not* produce a HAGMA
	Gastrointestinal toxicity, and ketosis without acidosis in addition to neurotoxicity.

# Disease


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

## Clinical Manifestations

Methanol:

* Ocular
	* Blurry vision
	* ↓ Acuity
	* Photophobia
	* "Snowstorm" vision
	* Permanent blindness
* Neurological
	* Parkinsonism
	* Transverse myelitis
	* Basal ganglia haemorrhages
* HAGMA
	* Formic acid
	* Lactic acid


Ethylene Glycol:

* Cardiopulmonary
	* ↑ HR
	* ARDS
	* Heart failure
	* ↓ Calcium\
	Chelated by oxalic acid.
* Renal toxicity
	* Precipitation of calcium oxalate crystals in renal tubule
* Neurological
	* Coma
	* Seizures
	* Meningism
	* Cranial nerve deficit\
	Often delayed by 5-20 days.
* HAGMA
	* Glycolic acid
	* Oxalic acid
	* Lactic acid


Isopropanol:

* Gastrointestinal
	* Haemorrhagic gastritis
* Neurological
	* Intoxication
	* Cerebellar signs
	* Coma


## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

**Bedside**:

* ABG
	* HAGMA
	* AG

**Laboratory**:

:::column-margin
Osmolar gap and anion gap change over time. Initially, the OG is ↑ due to the toxic alcohols, then as the alcohol is metabolised to acids the OG ↓ and the AG ↑.
:::

* Blood
	* UEC
	* Osmolar gap
	* Serum alcohol concentrations\
	Toxic levels usually only available after commencing treatment.

:::column-margin
If you can quantitatively measure the serum alcohol, you can also determine the contribution of that alcohol to the osmolar gap. 1mmol/L of:

* Ethanol: 4.6 mg/dL
* Methanol: 3.2 mg/dL
* Ethylene glycol: 6.2 mg/dL
* Isopropanol: 6.0 mg/dL
:::

**Imaging**:

* CTB
	* Methanol toxicity
		* Putamen necrosis
		* Basal ganglia haemorrhages
		* Optic chiasmal atrophy
		* Caudate nuclear necrosis

**Other**:

## Management

:::priority
* Treat **acidosis**
* Early **RRT**
* For methanol and ethylene glycol:
	* Give **antidote**
	* Give **cofactors**
:::

**Resuscitation**:

**Specific therapy**:

:::column-margin
Fomepizole is not available in Australia.
:::

* Pharmacological
	* **Antidote**\
	Inhibit conversion to toxic acids in methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning.
		* Agents:
			* Fomepizole 15mg/kg load, then 10mg/kg Q12H
			* Ethanol
		* Indicated for:
			* Osmolar gap >10mOsm
			* pH <7.3
			* Urinary oxalate crystals
	* **Sodium bicarbonate**
		* For metabolic acidosis
	* **Metabolic cofactors**\
	↑ Clearance of toxic metabolites to non-toxic metabolites.
		* Ethylene glycol toxicity
			* Pyridoxine 100mg IV Q6H and thiamine 100mg IV Q6H
		* Methanol toxicity
			* Folic acid 50mg IV Q4-6H
			* Folinic acid 1-2mg/kg IV Q4-6H
* Procedural
	* **RRT**
		* pH <7.25
		* Visual abnormalities
		* Renal failure
		* Refractory electrolyte derangements
		* Refractory haemodynamic instability
* Physical

**Supportive care**:

* G
	* PPI

**Disposition**:

* ICU if:
	* Acidaemia
	* End-organ dysfunction
* Toxicologically cleared if:
	* Toxic alcohol concentration <20mg/dL
	* No organ dysfunction
	* Haemodynamic stability
	* Normal pH

**Preventative**:
