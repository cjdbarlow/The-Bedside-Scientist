# Cyanide Toxicity {#sec-cyanide}


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

Cyanide binds to the ferric ion of cytochrome oxidase, leading to histotoxic hypoxia and cellular asphyxia.

### Aetiology

## Clinical Manifestations

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

**Bedside**:

**Laboratory**:

**Imaging**:

**Other**:

## Management

**Resuscitation**:

* B
	* Supplemental oxygen


**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
	* Hydroxocobalamin 5g IV over 15 minutes\
	Scavenges cyanide, which is then renally cleared.
	* Dicobalt edetate 300mg IV over 1 minute followed by 50mL of 50% dextrose
		* Reserved for confirmed severe toxicity as it may cause seizures, airway oedema, and hypotension
	* Sodium nitrate or amyl nitrate with sodium thiosulphate
* Procedural
* Physical

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:

**Preventative**:
