# Antepartum Haemorrhage


Vaginal bleeding occurring:

* After the 24^th^ week of pregnancy
* Prior to delivery
* Usually due to:
	* Placenta previa  
	* Abruptio placentae


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

APH:

* **Major cause** of maternal mortality
* Occurs in 3-5% of pregnancies

Placenta Previa:

* Usually ~1% of total pregnancies
* Risk factors:
	* Prior:
		* Placenta previa
		* LUSCS
		* Myomectomy
		* Endometrial trauma

	* Age
		* < 20 or > 35
	* Smoking
	* Previous uterine trauma
		* Previous surgery
			* Caesarian
			* Curettage
			* Manual removal of placenta
		* Endometritis


Placental abruption:

* Risk factors
	* Maternal thrombophilias  
	* Placental abruption  
	Previous abruption gives ~20% risk of subsequent abruption.
	* Smoking
	* Cocaine
	* Amphetamine


## Pathophysiology and Clinical Features

### Placenta Previa

Implantation of the placenta around the internal os of the cervix. Placenta previa is:

* *Painless*, fresh vaginal bleeding
* Classified into three types
	* Complete (37%)  
	Complete coverage of intenal os.
	* Partial (27%)  
	Partial coverage of the internal os.
	* Marginal (37%)  
	Placenta encroaches on internal os.
* Foetal distress and coagulpathy are rare

### Abruptio Placentae

Premature separation of placenta from the decidua basalis. Placental abruption is:

* Painful
* Generally older vaginal bleeding  
**Blood loss may be concealed**.
* Associated with foetal distress  
* Classified by:
	* Degree of blood loss:
		* Mild
		* Moderate
		* Severe
	* Placetal location:
		* Concealed haemorrhage  
		Bleeding trapped in uterus by placenta.
		* External haemorrhage  
		Blood flowing out of cervix.
		* External haemorrhage with placental prolapse

## Investigations

Maternal investigations are targeted towards assessing extent and consequences of haemorrhage. Investigations will depend on bleeding:

* FBE
* Coagulation screen  
If platelet count abnormal (suggestive of coagulopathy).
* Group and hold  
Cross-match 4 units if major haemorrhage.
* UEC
* LFT
* Kleihauer  
For Rh- mothers, to quantify extent of FMH.


Foetal investigations:

* CTG
	* Once mother stable or resuscitation commenced
	* Aids decision making on mode of delivery
	* In general, a non-reassuring trace should result in expedited delivery.

## Management

Critical care management centres on whether there is:

* **Active bleeding**  
* A **viable pregnancy**

If yes:

* Prepare for emergency LUSCS
	* Often under GA
	* Massive transfusion often required  
		* Transfuse at 1:1:1, as per trauma resuscitation
		* Early coagulation profile and haematology involvement
	* Careful induction of anaesthesia required
* Significant likelihood of post-partum hysterectomy

### Anaesthetic Considerations

* C
	* High likelihood of massive transfusion
	* Invasive arterial monitoring
* D
	* Anaesthetic technique
		* Regional  
		Appropriate if **no evidence of hypovolaemia**.
			* Reduced blood loss
			* Reduced aspiration
			* â†‘ hypotension
			* Technical difficulty
		* General
			* Haemodynamic stability
			* Difficult airway and aspiration risk
* H
	* DIC  
	May develop following profound haemorrhage.


### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

## Complications

Maternal complications:

* Haemorrhage
	 * Death
	 * Shock
	 * Anaemia
	 * Coagulopathy
	 * Prolonged hospital stay
	 * Blood transfusion

Foetal complications:

* Haemorrhage  
Particularly in vasa praevia or abruption.
* Hypoxia
	* Death
* Prematurity
* IUGR
