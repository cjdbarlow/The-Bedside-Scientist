# Eclampsia {#sec-eclampsia}

Life-threatening **generalised tonic-clonic seizure** and **coma** occurring in a **woman with pre-eclampsia** or gestational hypertension.

:::column-margin
This covers eclampsia. Pregnancy induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia is covered at @sec-preghtn.
:::

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Eclampsia:

* Occurs in ~0.05% of pregnancies
* Timing is variable:
	* 60% of cases occur antepartum
		* 50% pre-term
		* 20% 20-30 weeks
	* 20% intrapartum
	* 20% post-partum\
	90% within 1 week of delivery.
* Recurrent seizure in 10%

## Pathophysiology

Mechanisms are not well understood but may include:

* Loss of cerebral autoregulation
	* Hyperperfusion
	* Endothelial dysfunction
	* Vasogenic oedema
* Maintenance of autoregulation leading to extreme vasoconstriction
	* Hypoperfusion
	* Localised ischaemia

## Clinical Manifestations

Generalised tonic-clonic seizure with unconsciousness with a post-ictal period lasting 10-20 minutes, preceded in *most* cases by:

:::column-margin
Despite this, 25% of cases have no precipitating signs or symptoms.
:::

* Hypertension
* Headache
* Visual disturbances
* Abdominal pain
	* Epigastric
	* RUQ


Other features of pre-eclampsia may also be evident, including:

* Hyperreflexia/clonus
* Visual deficits
* Altered mental status
* Cranial nerve deficits

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

Bedside:

Laboratory:

Imaging:

* CTB\
Evaluate for intracranial complications.

Other:

## Management

:::info
Goals:

* Airway protection and aspiration prevention
* Correct hypertension
* Terminate seizure
* Prevent recurrent seizure
* Expedite delivery
:::

:::column-margin
Management of co-existing pre-eclampsia is crucial, and is covered at @sec-preghtn.
:::

**Resuscitation**:\

* A
	* Airway protection\
	Prevention of aspiration.
* B
	* Supplemental oxygen
{{< include /includes/preg_htn_resus.qmd >}}


**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
	* Blood pressure control
* Procedural
	* Expedite **delivery**


**Disposition**:

* ICU Admission\
	* Following seizure
	* Commonly required after delivery


### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

## Anaesthetic Considerations

## Complications

* Death
* A
	* Aspiration
* D
	* Intracranial haemorrhage
	* Cerebral oedema
	* Cerebral venous thrombosis

## Prognosis

## Key Studies
