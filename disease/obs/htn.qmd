# Hypertensive Diseases of Pregnancy {#sec-preghtn}

Hypertension in pregnancy is common and associated with significant maternal and foetal harm. It is classified into four sub-groups:

* **Gestational hypertension**
	* SBP > 140mmHg *or* DBP > 90mmHg
	* Present after 20^th^ week of gestation
	* Resolving following delivery\
	Usually within 6 weeks.
* **Pre-eclampsia/Eclampsia**
	* Pre-eclampsia is defined as **gestational hypertension** with **organ dysfunction** or **proteinuria**
	* Pre-eclampsia with severe features is pre-eclampsia with severe end-organ dysfunction
	* Eclampsia is defined as **pre-eclampsia** with **seizures**
* **Chronic hypertension**\
Pre-existing hypertension.
* **Chronic hypertension with super-imposed pre-eclampsia/eclampsia**

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Risk factors include:

* Patient factors:
	* Age > 35
	* Pre-existing HTN
	* CKD
	* DM
	* Anaemia
	* Living at altitude
	* *Non-*smokers
* Pregnancy factors:
	* Nulliparity
	* Multiple gestation

Pre-eclampsia is:

* A leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality
* Present in 5-8% of pregnancies\
Wide variation in incidence, with ↑ rates in under-resourced environments.


## Pathophysiology

Underlying processes driving placental insufficiency include:

* Maternal endothelial dysfunction
	* Altered endothelial function
		* ↑ Endothelial secretion
		* ↓ Nitric oxide
	* Normal development of a high-flow, low-resistance placental circulation does not occur
* Acute atherosclerosis and thrombosis of placental vessels\
Results in ↓ placental flow and structural blood vessel damage.

These processes:

* Lead to the triad of:
	* **Vasoconstriction**\
	* **Platelet** activation and **aggregation**
	* **Loss** of **circulating volume**
* Result in other end-organ dysfunction
	* A
		* Laryngeal oedema
	* C
		* High cardiac output state with inappropriate SVR
		* Diastolic dysfunction
		* ↓ Venous capacitance\
		Subsequently, generally normal filling pressures.
		Risk of acute LV failure if diastolic dysfunction present, especially if given volume.
	* D
		* Retinal vasospasm
		* Cerebral
			* Oedema
			* Haemorrhage
	* F
		* Oliguria
		* Uraemia
	* G
		* Synthetic coagulopathy
	* H
		* Consumptive coagulopathy


## Clinical Manifestations

Pre-eclampsia is classified by:

* **Gestational age** at diagnosis
	* Late\
	≥37 weeks.
		* Majority of cases
	* Preterm\
	34-37 weeks.
	* Early\
	<34 weeks.

:::column-margin
Earlier onset is associated with greater severity.

## Investigations

## Management

:::crisis
For **severe pre-eclampsia** or **hypertensive crisis**:

* Give **magnesium** for seizure prophylaxis
* Aim to **lower BP** by 10-20mmHg every 10-20 minutes to **↓ incidence** of **intracerebral haemorrhage**
:::

**Preventative:**

* Limit intravenous fluid\
IV fluid ↑ risk of APO.
	* Avoid if:
		* Euvolaemic
		* Renal function normal 
* Avoid NSAIDs\
Reduce APO risk.
* Aspirin\
Indicated in pregnancy with major risk factors for pre-eclampsia, including:
	* Pre-disposing medical conditions
		* SLE
		* Scleroderma
		* Anti-phospholipid syndrome
	* Chronic hypertension
	* Diabetes
	* CKD
	* Oocyte donation
	* Family history of pre-eclampsia\
	Mother or sister.


**Resuscitation**:\

{{< include /includes/preg_htn_resus.qmd >}}


**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
	* For non-severe hypertension:
		* Labetalol\
		Drug of choice.
			* 100-400mg PO BD-TDS
		* Nifedipine
			* 20-60mg PO SR
		* Methyldopa
			* 250-750mg PO TDS
		* Clonidine
			* 75-300μg PO TDS
		* Hydralazine
			* 25-50mg PO Q8H
		* Metoprolol
		* Propranolol
* Procedural
	* **Delivery**\
		* **Only curative option**\
		Note that pre-eclampsia can continue to worsen after delivery and may persist until after the puerperium.
		* Neuraxial techniques preferred in absence of coagulopathy\
		No clear advantage of any (CSE, epidural, single-shot spinal) technique.


**Disposition**:

* Admission\
ICU or HDU may be required for BP management, and after delivery.
* Delivery\
Timing of delivery is dependent on gestational age at time of onset of pre-eclampsia:
	* Previable (< 23^6^ weeks)
		* High risk patient
		* Will likely require either:
			* Termination of pregnancy
			* Extreme preterm delivery
	* 24-31^6^ weeks
		* High risk patient
		* Transfer to tertiary institution
		* Will likely require pre-term delivery
		* Aim to prolong pregnancy as able
	* 32-36^6^ weeks
		* Aim to prolong pregnancy
		* Delivery where appropriate paediatric support is available
	* 37^0^
		* Planned delivery

### Breastfeeding and Post-Partum Management

Ongoing and new-onset hypertension occur in the post-partum period. In addition to drugs used antenatally, drugs with low milk:maternal plasma ratios include:

* Enalapril
* Captopril

## Anaesthetic Considerations

* A
	* Laryngeal oedema
		* Note presence of stridor pre-induction
		* Use a smaller ETT
* C
	* Hypertension
		* Management is difficult
		* Hypertension with light GA/laryngoscopy may be problematic
		* Key questions:
			* What is the current BP?
			* What is the trend in the BP?
			* What antihypertensive agents is the patient taking?
	* Volume state\
	May have ↓ intravascular volume; **↑ hypotension with neuraxial techniques**.
* D
	* Likelihood of eclampsia\
	Evaluate presence of:
		* Headache
		* Hyperreflexia/clonus
		* Visual symptoms
		* Extreme hypertension
	* Anaesthetic technique
		* Epidural
			* Reduces BP, and improves placental perfusion
			* Provides analgesia during labour
			* Slow titration may be **better than spinal** in severe pre-eclampsia
			* Consider inserting early, prior to thrombocytopenia developing
			* Requires **normal coagulation profile prior**
				* Platelet count >70,000/ml\
				Higher is better. Institutional policy may differ.
				* Routine APTT/PT is not required unless:
					* Clinical history of bleeding
					* Other clinical condition that may contribute to coagulopathy
		* Spinal
			* Safe alternative
			* May require additional volume to compensate for the low-volume pre-eclamptic state
		* CSE
			* Preferable to spinal if surgery is long
		* GA
			* RSI associated with dangerous hypertension\
			Consider:
				* Labetalol 1mg/kg pre-induction\
				↓ BP without affecting foetal blood flow.
			* Magnesium ↑ sensitivity to muscle relaxants
* F
	* Volume state
		* Urine output
		* Thirst
* H
	* Coagulation profile

	
## Complications

Maternal complications of severe pre-eclampsia include:

* Death
	* 40% due to cerebral oedema/haemorrhage
	* 40% due to pulmonary\
	Usually iatrogenic fluid overload.
	* Hepatic failure\
	Including hepatic rupture.
* A
	* Airway obstruction\
	Vocal cord oedema due to ↓ oncotic and ↑ hydrostatic pressure.
* B
	* Pulmonary oedema\
		* *Usually* due to low oncotic pressure or ↑ capillary permeability
		* Rarely due to diastolic dysfunction
		* **Risk ↑ following delivery**
* D
	* Cerebral haemorrhage
	* Cerebral oedema
* F
	* Renal failure
* H
	* DIC


Foetal complications of pre-eclampsia include:

* IUGR
* FDIU
* Preterm birth

## Prognosis

Significant risk for maternal mortality:

* 4× for pre-eclampsia
* 40× for eclampsia


Morbidity persists even after delivery, with ↑ risk of:

* Death
* IHD
* CVA
* Renal disease
