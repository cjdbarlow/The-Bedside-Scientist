# Primary Postpartum Haemorrhage

Postpartum haemorrhage is a major cause of maternal mortality. With respect to PPH:

* Primary PPH is blood loss the first 24 hours post-partum that:
	* Exceeds 500mL
	* Causes haemodynamic instability
* Massive PPH is loss of >50% of the circulating blood volume

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

In Australia, PPH:

* Occurs at 6/1,000 deliveries\
Will likely ↑ over time:
	* ↑ maternal age
	* Conception following LUSCS\
	↑ percreta/accreta risk.
* Has a mortality of 4/100,000 deliveries


Risk factors for PPH relate to the cause:

* Atony
	* Maternal obesity
	* Maternal DM
	* Multiple pregnancy
	* Multiparity
	* Advanced maternal age
	* Prolonged labour
	* Augmented labour
	* Amniotic infection
	* Abnormal uterine anatomy
	* Uterine inversion
	* Macrosomia
* Tissue
	* Abnormal placenta
	* Retained clot
	* Previous uterine surgery
	* Placenta praevia
	* Placenta accreta/percreta
* Trauma
	* Precipitous delivery
	* Operative delivery
	* Foetal malposition
	* Multiparity
	* Previous uterine surgery
* Thrombin 
	* Hereditary disease\
		* von Willebrand's
		* Haemophilia
	* Acquired disease
		* ITTP
		* Pre-eclampsia
		* FDIU
		* Infection
		* Placental abruption
		* AFE
	* Therapeutic
		* Thromboprophylaxis

## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

Causes grouped into the **four T's**:

* A**t**ony\
Failure of uterine contraction.
	* Occurs in 10% of pregnancies
	* Causes 70% of PPH
* **T**rauma\
Second most common cause, due to injury to:
	* Uterus
	* Cervix
	* Vagina
	* Perineum
* **T**issue\
Retained products of conception.
	* Third most common cause
	* Generally retained placental fragment\
	May be related to placenta accreta.
* **T**hrombin\
Coagulopathy.

Other causes:

* Uterine inversion\
Where the fundus of the uterus begins to prolapse out of the cervix.
* Uterine rupture\
Usually along a scar from previous caesarian or uterine surgery.


## Clinical Features

:::caution
Many features may be **masked by the physiology** of pregnancy, and **blood loss** is often **underestimated**.
:::

Symptoms and signs of massive blood loss:

* Tachycardia
* Lightheadedness
* Sweating
* Pallor
* Weakness
* Hypotension\
Classically late sign in pregnant women.

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

PPH is due to either:

* Tone
	* Uterine atony
* Trauma
	* Uterine
	* Birth canal
* Tissue
	* Retained placenta or membranes
* Thrombin
	* Coaguolpathy
	* DIC

## Investigations

Key investigations:

* Group and Hold
* Coagulation studies
	* Including D-dimer

## Management

:::priority
* Haemostatic resuscitation
* Manage uterine causes:
	* Tone\
	Rubbing, uterotonics.
	* Trauma\
	Operative repair.
	* Tissue\
	Operative evacuation.
	* Thrombin\
	Medical treatment of coagulopathy.
:::

:::column-margin
An empty, intact, **contracted** uterus will not bleed *unless* there is coagulopathy.
:::


**Resuscitation**:

* C
	* IV access and warm volume resuscitation
	* Haemostatic resuscitation
* H
	* Consider TXA if <3 hours from birth


**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
	* **Uterotonics**\
	Ensure active management of the third stage has been completed.
		* Oxytocin 10 units IV\
		Commence infusion at 10 units/hr; usually 40 units in 1L of CSL/NS/D5W over 4 hours.
		* Ergometrine 0.25mg IM\
		Can give a further 0.25mg IV; beware bronchospasm and hypertension. Up to a total of 1mg.
		* Metoclopramide 10mg IV
		* Carboprost 0.25mg **IM**\
		Can repeat Q15 minutely, up to 2mg.
		* Consider misoprostol 1mg **PR**
		* Misoprostol
	* Uterine relaxation\
	May be required in some circumstances, such as uterine inversion.
		* Volatile anaesthetics
		* GTN
* Procedural
	* **Deliver placenta**
		* Controlled cord traction\
		Examine for completeness.
	* **Obstetric intervention**\
		* Uterine bleeding
		Escalating ladder of:
			* Uterine packing\
			Up to 24 hours, cover with IV antibiotics and continue oxytocin infusion.
			* Uterine artery ligation
			* Internal iliac ligation
			* B-lynch suture
			* Hysterectomy
			* Interventional radiology
		* Birth canal injury
		* Retained products of conception\
			* Requires operated delivery
			* May required uterine relaxation
* Physical
	* Haemorrhage control
		* Bimanual uterine compression
		* Aorta compression
	* **Uterine massage**\
	Rub up. Effective in most cases.


**Supportive care**:

* E
	* Avoid hypothermia
* H
	* Consider DDAVP 0.3μg/kg
		* Uraemia\
		≥20mmol/L.
		* von Willebrand's disease
	* Consider factor VIIa in refractory haemorrhage or DIC

**Disposition**:

**Preventative**:


## Anaesthetic Considerations

* C
	* Haemodynamic stability
		* Key guide for resuscitation goals
* D
	Anaesthetic techniques, in order of preference:\
		* Epidural top-up
		* Spinal anaesthesia
		* Intravenous sedation\
		May be appropriate in some instances.
		* General anaesthesia
