# Gastrointestinal Bleeding {#sec-gib}

Gastrointestinal bleeding is divided anatomically into:

:::column-margin
UGIB makes up 80% of all gastrointestinal bleeding and is much more likely to require procedural intervention.
:::

* Upper GI Bleeding\
Intraluminal bleeding proximal to the ligament of Treitz, from:
    * Oesophagus
        * Varices\
        Abnormally dilated veins at the junction of the portal and systemic venous systems.
            * Mallory-Weiss tears\
            5-15% of cases.
        * Oesophagitis
    * Stomach
        * Ulcers\
        ~15% of cases. **Acute stress ulceration** may occur after gastric hypoxia or hypopefusion in the critically unwell. 
        * Varices
        * Gastritis
        * Portal hypertensive gastropathy
    * Duodenum
        * Ulcers\
        ~60% of cases.
        * Duodenitis 
* Lower GI bleeding\
Intraluminal bleeding occurring distal to the ligament of Trietz, from:
    * Small bowel
        * Angiodysplasia
        * AVM
        * Meckel's Diverticulum
    * Colon
        * Diverticular bleeding\
        Most common cause, resolves spontaneously in >75% of cases.
        * Ischaemic colitis
        * Post-polypectomy bleeding
        * Polyps
        * Carcinoma
        * Radiation enteropathy
        * IBD
    * Rectum
        * Carcinoma
        * Haemorrhoids
        * Anal fissure

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Risk factors include:

* Critical illness
    * Acute stress ulceration in 8-45% of ICU patients


## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

## Clinical Manifestations

Features due to:

:::column-margin
Pain is less commonly a feature with ulcers in the elderly and NSAID users.\
\
Melaena describes black tarry stools and suggests UGIB. Haematochezia describes bright red or maroon blood and suggests LGIB.
:::

* Bleeding
    * Haematemesis\
    Bright red haematemesis suggests active oesophageal, stomach, or upper duodenal bleeding.
    * Pain
    * Vomiting\
    History of vigorous vomiting prior to onset of bleeding suggests a Mallory-Weiss tear of oesophageal varicies.
* Hypovolaemia
    * Tachycardia
    * Tachypnoea
    * Hypotension
    * Impaired organ perfusion
        * Anxiety
        * Confusion
        * Oliguria 

:::caution
Severe UGIB indicated by:

* SBP <100mmHg
* Transfusion >4 PRBC in 12 hours
* Frank haematemesis
* Syncope
:::

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

Bloods:

* FBE
* Coagulation screen
* LFTs

Radiology:

* Angiography\
Usually performed as part of interventional embolisation strategy, but can identify bleeding points for subsequent intervention.

## Management

:::crisis
If intubation is required, ensure adequate **volume resuscitation prior to induction** due to the risk of profound haemodynamic instability.
:::

:::column-margin
Anaesthetic considerations and management is covered under @sec-scopes.
:::

**Resuscitation**:\

:::column-margin
Note that **overresuscitation** may lead to **increased portal venous pressure** and should be avoided.
:::

* A
    * Definitive airway if airway compromised\
    Very high aspiration risk.
* C
    * Wide-bore IV
    * Volume resuscitation
        * MTP
* H 
    * Urgent crossmatch

**Specific therapy**:

:::column-margin
The majority of patients with UGIB will stop bleeding spontaneously and not require procedural intervention. The overwhelming majority of patients with LGIB will stop bleeding prior to *any* intervention.
:::

* Pharmacological
    * **Cease anticoagulation**
    * **Cease NSAID**
    * **Acid suppression**\
    Inadequate without endoscopic control in severe or persistent bleeding. No evidence to support use pre-endoscopy, but decreased rebleeding and repeated endoscopy when used post-bleeding.
        * PPI
        * H~2~-antagonist
    * For **variceal bleeds**:
        * ↓ Portal pressure
            * Vasopressin
                * May precipitate hypertension and cardiac ischaemia
            * Terlipressin\
            Preferable to vasopressin due to ↓ cardiac side effects. Improves haemostasis and mortality in variceal bleeding.
            * Octreotide\
            ↓ Portal blood flow, no demonstrated mortality improvement.
        * Propranolol\
        Secondary prevention of variceal bleeding. 
        * Antibiotics\
       High risk of concomitant (or precipitating) infection in variceal bleeds.
* Procedural\
    * Balloon tamponade\
    Insertion of a gastric-oesopahgeal balloon which is placed to provide balloon tamponade feeding veins. Used only *in extremis* to provide control of bleeding.
    * **Endoscopy**\
    Gold standard of treatment for severe bleeding, or patients with rebleeding.
        * Early (<24 hours) associated with:
            * ↓ Transfusion
            * ↓ Rebleeding
            * ↓ Open surgical risk
            * ↓ Length of stay
        * Therapeutic options include:
            * Dilute adrenaline injection
            * Cauterisation
            * Stapling of ulcer\
            ↓ Risk of perforation compared with cauterisation.
            * Variceal band ligation\
            Rubber bands used to strangle varices, to decrease future risk of bleeding.
        * Repeat endoscopy should be performed if initial endoscopy suboptimal
    * **Embolisation**
        * Effective at achieving immediate haemostasis
        * Small risk of gut ischaemia and rebleeding
        * Useful in patients at high surgical risk
    * **Surgical** bowel resection\
    Largely superseded by endoscopy but has a role in:
        * Massive transfusion with ongoing haemodynamic instability
        * Recurrent bleeding despite initial endoscopic success
        * Arterial bleeding not controlled by endoscopic haemostasis
        * GI perforation
    * TIPS\
    Indicated in variceal bleeding refractory to control by all other methods. Results in:
        * Significantly decreased portal venous pressure and variceal bleeding
        * Hepatic encephalopathy in 60%

:::column-margin
**Urgent endoscopy** is preferable for suspected *ulcer* bleeding; haemodynamically stable suspected **variceal bleeding** is appropriate to defer until the **next elective list**.
:::

**Disposition**:

* Consider *H. Pylori* eradication
    * More effective than acid suppression 


### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies


## Complications

* Death\
4-10% of cases.
* A
    * Aspiration

## Prognosis

Poor prognostic factors include:

* Inpatient
* Age >60
* CLD\
Portal hypertension increases size and bleeding rate of varices.
* Known varices
* Haemodynamic instability
