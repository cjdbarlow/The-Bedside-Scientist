# Mesenteric Ischaemia

Abdominal surgical emergncy due to interruption of blood supply to the abdominal viscera, which can be classified by aetiology:

* **Arterial occlusion**\
Presentation with abdominal pain and GI symptoms followed by peritonism and shock. Causes include:
	* Plaque rupture and thrombus
	* Arterial embolism
	* Venous occlusion\
	Rare.
* **Venous occlusion**\
* **Non-occlusive ischaemia** (NOMI)\
Severe GI symptoms in the setting of severe circulatory failure, usually with evidence of other organ failures (AKI, ischaemic hepatitis).

:::column-margin
Arterial occlusion causes ~50% of cases, and venous occlusion for ~10%.

:::column-margin
**Chronic mesenteric ischaemia** occurs to atherosclerotic plaque causing partial occlusion of the mesenteric vessels, leading to a form of 'intestinal angina' characterised by:

* Post-prandial pain
* Weight loss
* "Food fear"
:::


## Pathophysiology

* Arterial occlusion results in ischaemia of a single vascular territory
* Non-occlusive ischaemia results in watershed ischaemia
	* Pancreas, between the coeliac and SMA
	* Splenic flexure, between the SMA and IMA 

:::column-margin
The SMA is the most vulnerable to embolic ischaemia due to a higher blood flow rate, larger diameter, and low take-off angle from the abdominal aorta. Emboli classically lodge 3-10cm from the origin of the SMA, and spare the proximal jejunum and colon.
:::


## Clinical Features

:::caution
Diagnosis requires a high level of clinical suspicion.
:::

Features are generally non-specific, aetiology is determined on history and investigations:

:::column-margin
The exception is that **arterial occlusion** typically has an **abrupt onset**, venous occlusion and NOMI have a more subacute onset.
:::

:::column-margin
Pain in NOMI classically id more diffuse and associated with a period of low CO.
:::

* Abdominal **pain**\
Typically **severe and out of proportion** to the clinical exam findings.
* Nausea, vomiting
* Diarrhoea
* PR bleeding
* Peritonism\
Late sign, generally indicates irreversible ischaemia and bowel necrosis.

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

**Blood**:

* Lactate
	* Metabolic acidosis with ↑ lactate occurs in ~90% of patients
	* Lactataemia is not sufficient for diagnosis, but should prompt consideration for CT

**Imaging**:

* CT mesenteric angiogram
	* Bowel ischaemia
		* Portal venous gas
		* Intestinal pneumatosis

:::column-margin
![SMA Occlusion](/resources/mesenteric.png)
:::

**Other**:

* Endoscopy
	* Visual identification of ischaemia

## Management

:::priorities
* **Treat shock**
* **Restore perfusion** to ischaemic areas, if possible
* Urgent **resection of non-viable bowel** prior to perforation
:::

**Resuscitation**:

* C
	* Fluid resuscitation
	* Arterial line
	* Vasopressors should be used to avoid fluid overload
		* Milrinone and dobutamine are preferable
	* Correct underlying shock state
* G
	* Nasogastric decompression
	* Correct concurrent or underlying shock


**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
	* **Anticoagulation**\
	For venous ischaemia.
		* Unfractionated heparin infusion
* Procedural
	* **Laparotomy**
		* Mandated for overt peritonitis
		* Resect non-viable regions
		* Damage control surgery is normal and planned re-look laparotomy within 48 hours is usual
	* **Restoration of arterial perfusion**
		* **Endovascular**
			* Stenting
			* Catheter-directed thrombolysis or clot retrieval\
			Can be available for venous or arterial occlusion.
		* **Open repair** (including bypass)
* Physical

:::column-margin
Identifying massive gut necrosis should prompt re-evaluation of the appropriateness of curative intent.
:::

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:

### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

* Intravenous thrombolysis\
Successful cases are described, but this is precluded by bowel ischaemia or infarction and so if used must be attempted early.

## Anaesthetic Considerations

## Complications

* Death
* G
	* Short bowel syndrome\
	After resection.
	* Perforation

## Prognosis

Mortality depends intestinal viability, and therefore early diagnosis. In general:

* Occlusive arterial ischaemia has a good prognosis with early detection and aggressive intervention
* Occlusive venous ischaemia has a good prognosis, assuming no bowel necrosis
* The prognosis in NOMI depends on the underlying condition and response to shock
