# Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure

Acute decompensation of stable compensated or uncompensated chronic liver disease with high short-term mortality, characterised by:

* Ascites
* Encephalopathy
* Gastrointestinal haemorrhage
* Infection


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

Common precipitants include:

* Infection
	* Bacterial peritonitis
* Variceal haemorrhage
* Alcoholic hepatitis\
Acute onset of jaundice or ascites in a patient with chronic alcohol abuse.
* HCC
* Portal vein thrombosis

## Clinical Manifestations

Usual presentations include:

* Encephalopathy
* Sepsis
* Renal failure
* Variceal haemorrhage

### Hepatic Encephalopathy

Brain dysfunction that:

* Occurs due to:
	* Liver insufficiency
	* Portosystemic shunting
* Has a wide variety of lclinical appearances
	* INaddtention
	* Psychomotor rtardation
	* Personality changes
	* Agitation
	* Somnolence
	* Coma
* Onset defined as either onset of:
	* Asterixis
	* Confusion
* Contibuted to by septic encephalopathy

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

Radiology:

* Ultrasound
	* Portal vein patency
	* Hepatic vein patency
	* Malignancy


Pathology:

* Ascitic tap

## Management

**Resuscitation**:\

**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
	* Hyperammonaemia\
	Aim to ↓ gut load of ammonia-producing bacteria.
		* Lactulose
		* Rifaximin\
		Non-absorbable broad-spectrum antibiotic that ↓ gut flora concentrations.
	* Feeding\
	Protein load may contribute to ↑ ammonia.
* Procedural
* Physical


**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:
