# Acute Liver Failure

Rapidly progressive, life-threatening development of **coagulopathy**, **encephalopathy**, and **jaundice** in a patient with a previously normal liver. ALF is subclassified by time interval between jaundice and encephalopathy:

* Hyperacute\
Encephalopathy within 7 days. Typically:
	* Severe encephalopathy, coagulopathy, ↑ ICP, and very deranged LFTs
	* Aetiologies are paracetamol, viral hepatitis
	* Good recovery
* Acute\
Encephalopathy within 28 days. Typically:
	* More gradual decline
	* Aetiologies are idiosyncratic drug reactions, viral hepatitis
* Subacute\
Encephalopathy within 3 months. Typically:
	* Less deranged LFTs
	* Aetiologies are *un*likely to be pregnancy-related or viral. 
	* Poorest recovery



:::column-margin
Acute Liver Failure is distinct from:

* **Acute Liver Injury**\
Coagulopathy in absence of encephalopathy.
* **Acute on Chronic Liver Failure**\
Acute decline in liver function in patients with chronic liver disease.

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

* Direct hepatocyte damage
* Immune response
	* Local
	* Systemic
		* MODS
* Cerebral dysfunction
	* Oedema
	* Altered autoregulation

### Aetiology

* Ischaemia
* Vascular
* Infection
* Autoimmune
* Drugs/toxins
	* Paracetamol\
	50-70% in the developed world.
	* Aspirin\
	Reye's syndrome.
	* Alcohol
	* Herbal
	* Halothane
* Pregnancy-related\
	* Acute fatty liver of pregnancy
	* Severe pre-eclampsia


## Clinical Manifestations

History:

:::column-margin
Hepatic encephalopathy graded into:

1. Mild confusion/irritability, ↓ attention
2. Disorientation, drowsiness, inappropriate
3. Somnolent but rousable, incoherent
4. Coma
:::

* Overdose
* CNS
	* Confusion
	* Agitation
* GI
	* Nausea/Vomiting

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

Blood:

* Liver function testing\
Severity and pattern of injury:
	* Hepatocellular
	* Cholestatic
* Point of care coagulation studies\
*May* be more accurate than standard assays.
* Coagulation studies
	* Synthetic function
* Lactate\
Failure of hepatic clearance.
* Ammonia\
Neurotoxin responsible for much of hepatic encephalopathy. ↑ Ammonia may reflect:
	* Hepatic metabolic dysfunction\
	Degree of hepatic dysfunction typically correlates with ammonia level, though not with the degree of encephalopathy.
	* ↑↑ Protein intake
	* ↑ GI ammonia production\
	Produced by gut bacteria.
	* ↓ Clearance\
	Urea cycle disorder.
* UEC\
	* AKI
	* Electrolyte derangements
* FBE
	* Anaemia
	* Thrombocytopaenia
	* Concurrent infection
* Lipase/amylase
	* Associated pancreatitis
* Paracetamol level
* LDH\
Malignancy.
* Viral screen\
Aetiology. Include:
	* Hepatitis A/B/C/E
	* EBV
	* HSV
	* VZV
	* HIV 1/2
* Autoimmune screen
	* ANA\
	Autoimmune.
	* Anti-smooth muscle Ab\
	Autoimmune.
	* Anti-mitochondrial Ab\
	Primary sclerosing cholangitis.
	* Copper studies\
	Wilson's disease.
* Pregnancy test


Urine:

* Drug screen
	* Paracetamol


Radiology:

* TTE
	* RV function

	* Splenomegaly
	* Ascites
	* Nodularity
	* Hepatomegaly

## Management

:::info
Goals of therapy are:

* Identify cause
* Supportive care to limit hepatic damage
* Early identification of patients for transplant
	* Significant improvement in outcomes with **emergency liver transplantation**
	* **Early** escalation to **critical care** and early referral to a **specialist centre** is essential

: King's College Criteria for Liver Transplantation

The King's criteria are widely used but validation is less well supported, particularly in the paracetamol cohort.
:::

:::column-margin
An alternative to the King's criteria is the MELD score, which predicts 90 day survival using:

* Bilirubin
* INR
* Creatinine
:::

* A\
Consider securing if:
	* High grade (III/IV) encephalopathy
	* Need for transfer
 B
	* CO~2~ control for ICP management
* C
	* Classically distributive shock picture
		* Noradrenaline
* D
	* ↑ ICP\
		* Control with standard ICP management


**Specific therapy**:

* Liver transplantation
* Extra-corporeal hepatic support\
Artificial, extra-corporeal liver replacement therapy. Broadly, ↓ encephalopathy and ↑ haemodynamic function without mortality benefit. May be:
	* Biological\
	Using human/porcine cells.
	* Mechanical\
	Molecular filtration.

**Underlying cause**:

* Alcoholic hepatitis
* Paracetamol overdose
	* N-acetyl cysteine
		* 150mg/kg load, then 50mg/kg over 4 hours
* Hepatitis B
	* Lamivudine\
	Benefit if given early.
* Wilson's disease
	* D-Penicillamine\
	Chelates copper.
* Hepatic vein thrombosis
	* Lysis
	* Clot retreival
	* TIPS
* Viral hepatitis
	* Antivirals

**Supportive care**:

* B
	* Lung protective ventilation\
	ARDS risk.
	* Drain pleural effusions
* D
	* ↑ ICP\
		* Consider invasive ICP management if **all** of:
			* Grade 3-4 encephalopathy
			* Hyperacute liver failure
			* Ammonia >150mmolL
			* Young
* E
	* ↓ BSL\
	Use high-concentration dextrose to avoid cerebral oedema/↓ Na^+^.
* F
	* ↓ Phosphate\
	Replenish.
	* RRT\
		* Avoid citrate!
		* CRRT preferential due to haemodynamics
		* In addition to standard indications, consider for:
			* Hyperammonaemia\
			Aim <100umol/L to ↓ cerebral oedema.
			* Hypothermia
* G
	* Early enteral feeding\
	May have ↑ metabolic requirements. No change in protein requirement.
	* Lactulose\
	Controversial. May ↓ hepatic encephalopathy but lead to gaseous intestinal distension.
	* PPI
	* Drain ascites\
	For haemodynamic benefit.
* H
	* Coagulopathy\
	Treat if bleeding or prior to procedures. Patients may be prothrombotic, anti-thrombotic, or fibrinolytic, and the assays themselves (both coagulation profiles and point-of-care testing) may not correlate with the observed clinical effect.
		* Vitamin K\
		Very reasonable, probably ineffective.



**Disposition**:

* Liver transplant centre

### Ineffective Therapies

## Anaesthetic Considerations

## Complications

* Death
	* Intracranial hypertension\
	Classically if untreated.
	* Sepsis/multiorgan failure


* A
	* Unprotected airway
* B
	* ARDS\
	Relatively intolerant of permissive hypercapnoea due to ↑ ICP concerns.
	* Pleural effusions
* C
	* Distributive shock
* D
	* Intracranial hypertension
	* Hepatic encephalopathy
* F
	* AKI (hepatorenal syndrome)\
	40-80% of cases.
		* ↑ In paracetamol toxicity (directly nephrotoxic)
* G
	* ↓ BSL
	* Pancreatitis
	* Ascites
* H
	* Coagulopathy\
	May be variable and not in keeping with assays.
	* Bone marrow suppression
		* Thrombocytopaenia
* I
	* Infection\
	↑ Susceptibility.

## Prognosis

:::info
Eligibility for transplantation is determined using one of the prognostic scores, such as MELD or the King's College criteria.
:::

Factors:

* Age
↑ Mortality with ↑ age.
* Aetiology
↓ Mortality with pregnancy-related causes.
* Acuity\
↑ Mortality with ↑ acuity.

Transplantation:

* 80% 5-year survival following liver transplant for ALF
