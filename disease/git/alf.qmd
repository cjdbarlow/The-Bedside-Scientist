# Acute Liver Failure

Rapidly progressive, life-threatening development of **coagulopathy**, **encephalopathy**, and **jaundice** in a patient with a previously normal liver due to massive liver parenchymal injury. ALF is subclassified by time interval between jaundice and encephalopathy:

* Hyperacute\
Encephalopathy within 7 days. Typically:
	* Severe encephalopathy, coagulopathy, ↑ ICP, and very deranged LFTs\
	Encephalopathy usually preceeds jaundice.
	* Common aetiologies: paracetamol, viral hepatitis
	* Higher rate of spontaneous recovery
* Acute\
Encephalopathy within 28 days. Typically:
	* More gradual decline
	* Common aetiologies: idiosyncratic drug reactions, viral hepatitis
* Subacute\
Encephalopathy within 3 months. Typically:
	* Less deranged LFTs
	* Common aetiologies are drug or immune-mediated disease and *un*likely to be pregnancy-related or viral. 
	* Poorest recovery in absence of transplantation



:::column-margin
Acute Liver Failure is distinct from:

* **Acute Liver Injury**\
Coagulopathy in absence of encephalopathy.
* **Acute on Chronic Liver Failure**\
Acute decline in liver function in patients with chronic liver disease.
:::


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Rare:

* 400 cases annually in the UK


## Pathophysiology

Pathological processes:

* Direct hepatocyte damage
* Immune response
	* Local
	* Systemic
		* MODS
* Cerebral dysfunction
	* Oedema
	* Altered autoregulation

### Aetiology

:::column-margin
Cause varies substantially with geography.
:::

* **Vascular**
	* Ischaemia
	* Budd-Chiari Syndrome\
	Hepatic vein thrombosis, usually with an underlying procoagulant condition.
* **Infection**
	* Hepatitis A\
	Infection rarely leads to liver failure (<1%) and contributes to ~10% of infective cases.
	* Hepatitis B\
	25-75% of viral cases. **Reactivation** may occur in immunosuppressed patients.
	* Hepatitis C\
	Common cause of CLD but rarely causes acute failure.
	* Other viruses may cause rarely infection in the immunocompromised:
		* EBV
		* Measles
		* HSV 1/2
	* Dengue
	* Yellow fever
	* Lassa
* **Autoimmune**
* **Drugs**/toxins
	* **Paracetamol**\
	50-70% of cases in the developed world. Occurs due to:
		* Depletion of hepatic glutathione\
		Consumed in conjugating NAPQI, a Phase I metabolite of paracetamol.
		* NAPQI accumulation causes direct hepatocyte injury
	* Aspirin\
	Reye's syndrome.
	* Herbal
	* Halothane
	* Antituberculosis drugs
	* Alcohol
	* Ecstasy
	* *Amanita phalloides*\
	Mushroom poisoning. Usually presents with diarrhoea, followed by hepatic necrosis at 48-72 hours.
* Pregnancy-related\
	* Acute fatty liver of pregnancy
	* Severe pre-eclampsia
	* Liver rupture
* Hyperthermia
* Other
	* Wilson disease
	* Haemophagocytic syndrome


## Clinical Manifestations

History:

:::column-margin
The Parson-sSmith scale grades hepatic encephalopathy into:

1. Mild confusion/irritability, ↓ attention
2. Disorientation, drowsiness, inappropriate
3. Somnolent but rousable, incoherent
4. Coma
:::

* Overdose
* CNS
	* Encephalopathy
		* Confusion
		* Agitation
* GI
	* Nausea/Vomiting
	* Diarrhoea

Examination:

* Asterixis
* Intracranial hypertension
	* Hyperreflexia
	* Clonus
	* Hypertonicity
	* Cushing's triad
* Jaundice


## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

Blood:

* Liver function testing\
Severity and pattern of injury:
	* Hepatocellular
	* Cholestatic
* Point of care coagulation studies\
*May* be more accurate than standard assays.
* Coagulation studies
	* Synthetic function
* Lactate\
Failure of hepatic clearance.
* Ammonia\
Neurotoxin responsible for much of hepatic encephalopathy. ↑ Ammonia may reflect:
	* Hepatic metabolic dysfunction\
	Degree of hepatic dysfunction typically correlates with ammonia level, though not with the degree of encephalopathy.
	* ↑↑ Protein intake
	* ↑ GI ammonia production\
	Produced by gut bacteria.
	* ↓ Clearance\
	Urea cycle disorder.
* UEC\
	* AKI
	* Electrolyte derangements
* FBE
	* Anaemia
	* Thrombocytopaenia
	* Concurrent infection
* Lipase/amylase
	* Associated pancreatitis
* Paracetamol level
* LDH\
Malignancy.
* Viral screen\
Aetiology. Include:
	* Hepatitis A
	* Hepatitis B\
	Core antigen indicates infection. Surface antigen often negative.
	* Hepatitis C\
	Positive antibodies indicate infection.
	* Hepatitis E\
	Positive antibodies indicate infection. Usually faecal-oral, though a subtype is transmissable by blood.
	* EBV
	* HSV
	* VZV
	* HIV 1/2
* Autoimmune screen
	* ANA\
	Autoimmune.
	* Anti-smooth muscle Ab\
	Autoimmune.
	* Anti-mitochondrial Ab\
	Primary sclerosing cholangitis.
	* Copper studies\
	Wilson's disease.
* Pregnancy test

:::column-margin
Ammonia >200μmol/L associated with cerebral herniation.
:::

Urine:

* Drug screen
	* Paracetamol


Radiology:

* TTE
	* RV function
	* Transplant assessment
* Liver ultrasound
	* Splenomegaly
	* Ascites
	* Nodularity
	* Hepatomegaly
	* Portal blood flow
	* Portal patency
* CT\
Triple-phase liver.


Pathology:

* Liver biopsy
	* Rare in acute setting due to coagulopathy\
	Transjugular route safest.
	* Non-specific necrosis most common finding
	* May be useful in diagnosis of:
		* Autoimmune
		* Wilson's disease

## Management

:::info
Goals of therapy are:

* Identify cause
* Supportive care to limit hepatic damage
* Early identification of patients for transplant
	* Significant improvement in outcomes with **emergency liver transplantation**
	* **Early** escalation to **critical care** and early referral to a **specialist centre** is essential
:::

**Resuscitation**:\

* A\
Consider securing if:
	* High grade (III/IV) encephalopathy
	* Need for transfer
 B
	* CO~2~ control for ICP management
* C
	* Classically distributive shock picture
		* Noradrenaline
* D
	* ↑ ICP\
		* Control with standard ICP management


**Specific therapy**:

* Liver transplantation
* Extra-corporeal hepatic support\
Artificial, extra-corporeal liver replacement therapy. Broadly, ↓ encephalopathy and ↑ haemodynamic function without mortality benefit. May be:
	* Biological\
	Using human/porcine cells.
	* Mechanical\
	Molecular filtration.

**Underlying cause**:

:::column-margin
Management of paracetamol overdose is covered under @sec-pmolod.
:::

* Paracetamol overdose
	* **N-acetylcysteine** (NAC)\
		* Cornerstone of therapy as early administration results in significant reduction in mortality (to <1%), though even late administration may improve outcome
		* Dosing based on Prescott nomogram
* Viral hepatitis
	* Antivirals
	* Hepatitis B
		* Lamivudine\
		Benefit if given early.
* Alcoholic hepatitis
* Autoimmune hepatitis
	* Ste
* Mushroom poisoning
	* Forced diuresis\
	↑ Renal clearance of toxin. Avoid hypovolaemia.
* Wilson's disease
	* D-Penicillamine\
	Chelates copper. Withdrawal of chronic treatment may precipitate failure.
* Hepatic vein thrombosis
	* Thrombolysis
	* Clot retrieval
	* TIPS

**Supportive care**:

:::column-margin
Invasive intracranial pressure monitoring associated with ~10% intracranial haemorrhage rate.
:::

* B
	* Lung protective ventilation\
	ARDS risk.
	* Drain pleural effusions
* D
	* ↑ ICP\
		* General measures\
		If **grade 3/4** encephalopathy, recommend:
			* Intubation
			* Sedation
			* Avoid stimulation
			* Head-up positioning
		* Consider invasive ICP management if **all** of:\
			* Grade 3-4 encephalopathy
			* Hyperacute liver failure
			* Ammonia >150mmolL
			* Young
* E
	* ↓ BSL\
	Use high-concentration dextrose to avoid cerebral oedema/↓ Na^+^.
* F
	* ↓ Phosphate\
	Replenish.
	* RRT\
		* Avoid citrate!
		* CRRT preferential due to haemodynamics
		* In addition to standard indications, consider for:
			* Hyperammonaemia\
			Aim <100μmol/: to ↓ cerebral oedema.
			* Hypothermia
* G
	* Early enteral feeding\
	May have ↑ metabolic requirements. No change in protein requirement.
	* Lactulose\
	Controversial. May ↓ hepatic encephalopathy but lead to gaseous intestinal distension.
	* PPI
	* Drain ascites\
	For haemodynamic benefit.
* H
	* Coagulopathy\
	Treat if bleeding or prior to procedures. Patients may be prothrombotic, anti-thrombotic, or fibrinolytic, and the assays themselves (both coagulation profiles and point-of-care testing) may not correlate with the observed clinical effect.
		* Vitamin K\
		Very reasonable, probably ineffective in the majority of patients.



**Disposition**:

* Liver transplant centre

### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

## Anaesthetic Considerations

## Complications

* Death
	* Intracranial hypertension\
	Classically if untreated.
	* Sepsis/multiorgan failure


* A
	* Unprotected airway
* B
	* ARDS\
	Relatively intolerant of permissive hypercapnoea due to ↑ ICP concerns.
	* Pleural effusions
* C
	* Distributive shock
* D
	* Intracranial hypertension\
	Usually develops rapidly with little time for adaptation.
	* Hepatic encephalopathy
* F
	* AKI (hepatorenal syndrome)\
	40-80% of cases.
		* ↑ In paracetamol toxicity (directly nephrotoxic)
* G
	* ↓ BSL
	* Pancreatitis
	* Ascites
* H
	* Coagulopathy\
	May be variable and not in keeping with assays.
	* Bone marrow suppression
		* Thrombocytopaenia
* I
	* Infection\
	↑ Susceptibility due to functional immunosuppression.

## Prognosis

Spontaneous recovery occurs in only **40%**. Factors:

* Age
↑ Mortality with ↑ age.
* Aetiology
↓ Mortality with pregnancy-related causes.
* Acuity\
↑ Mortality with ↑ acuity.

Transplantation:

* 80% 5-year survival following liver transplant for ALF

### Scoring {#sec-alfscoring}

:::info
Eligibility for transplantation is determined using one of the prognostic scores, such as MELD or the King's College criteria.

: King's College Criteria for Liver Transplantation

The King's criteria are widely used but validation is less well supported, particularly in the paracetamol cohort.

An alternative to the King's criteria is the MELD score, which predicts 90 day survival using:

:::column-margin
The MELD score:

* Is calculated by sum of logarithms\
Use an app.
* Initially developed to predict mortality for TIPS
* Subsequently used to prognosticate and prioritise liver transplantation
:::

* Bilirubin
* INR
* Creatinine

| MELD Score | Mortality |
| ---------- | --------- |
| >40        | 71%       |
| 30-39      | 53%       |
| 20-29      | 20%       |
| 10-19      | 6%        |
| <9         | 2%        |
