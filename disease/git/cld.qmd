# Chronic Liver Disease/Cirrhosis


End result of a process of progressive destruction and regeneration of liver parenchyma, leading to fibrosis and cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is:

* A leading cause of death
* Greatly increases perioperative morbidity and mortality

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

Causes include:

* Viral hepatitis  
	* Hepatitis B
	* Hepatitis C
* Autoimmune disease
* Alcoholic liver disease

Rarer causes include:

* Cholestasis
	* Primary biliary cirrhosis
	* Sclerosing cholangitis
* Venous obstruction
* Drugs
* Toxins
* Metabolic diseases
	* Wilson's Disease
	* Haemochromatosis
	* α1-antitrypsin

## Clinical Manifestations

Classified into:

* Hepatic
* Extrahepatic
	* Cardiac
		* Hepatopulmonary syndrome  
		Shunt due to pulmonary vasodilation in excess of ventilation, possibly due to decreased hepatic clearance of endogenous vasodilators. 
		* Porto-pulmonary hypertension  
		Pulmonary hypertension (not due to left heart failure, i.e. ↑ PVR with a normal PCWP) in the setting of portal hypertension.
	* Endocrine
		* Secondary hyperaldosteronism
	* Renal
		* Hepatorenal syndrome  
		End-stage manifestation of worsening renal perfusion that occurs in portal hypertension.
			* Related to the progression of portal hypertension, rather than the progression of the hepatic lesion
			* Note that the kidneys are functional and intact  
			Renal function will return if portal hypertension is resolved (i.e. liver transplantation, or transplantation of the kidneys to a new host).
			* Occurs due to fall in renal perfusion pressure due to systemic vasodilation
			* Poor prognosis
	* GIT
		* Portal hypertension  
		Portal pressure >10mmHg. Leads to:
			* Collateral venous circulation
			* Ascites
			* Splenomegaly  
			Thrombocytopaenia due to sequestration.
			* Oesophageal varices
		* Delayed gastric emptying
	* Haeme
		* Anaemia  
		Multiple potential causes:
			* GIT bleeding
			* Hypersplenic haemolysis
			* Malnutrition
			* Anaemia of chronic disease
		* Coagulopathy  
		Reduced synthesis of both pro- and anti-coagulant factors.

### Child-Pugh Score

Score to assess prognosis of cirrhosis:

* Initially developed to predict perioperative mortality
* Validated for prognostication and to assess necessity of liver transplantation

|Value|1 point|2 points|3 points|
|--|--|-
|**Total bilirubin** (μmol/L)|⩽34|34-50|⩾50|
|**Serum albumin** (g/dL)|⩾3.5|2.8-3.5|⩽2.8|
|**PT** (s)|⩽4|4-6|⩾6
|**INR**|⩽1.7|1.7-2.3|⩾2.3|
|**Ascites**|None|Mild/medically controlled|Moderate to severe/refractory|
|**Hepatic encephalopathy**|None|Grade I-II|Grade III-IV|

Patients are then risk stratified as follows:

|Class|Points|One-year survival|
|--|--|
|A|5-6|100%|
|B|7-9|80%|
|C|10-15|45%|

### MELD Score

Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score:

* Initially developed to predict mortality for TIPS
* Subsequently used to prognosticate and prioritise liver transplantation

Uses:

* Serum bilirubin
* Serum creatinine
* INR

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx


## Investigations

Bloods:

* FBE
	* Anaemia
	* Thrombocytopaenia
* Coagulation assays
	* PT  
	Prognostic indicator, especially post-surgery in CLD.
* UEC
	* Baseline renal function important

## Management

### Anaesthetic Considerations

>End-stage liver disease associated with high perioperative morbidity and mortality

* A
	* Aspiration risk  
	Due to delayed gastric emptying. Consider RSI.
* B
	* Presence of ascites or pleural effusions  
	Restrict alveolar ventilation, FRC, and predispose to atelectasis and hypoxia.
* C
	* Presence of alcoholic cardiomyopathy
	* Typically hyperdynamic circulation  
	High CO, low SVR.
* D
	* Wernicke's encephalopathy
	* Hepatic encephalopathy
* E
	* Neuromuscular blockade
		* Non-depolarising agents:
			* Require increased doses  
			Due to increased V~D~.
			* Aminosteroids have prolonged elimination
* H
	* Coagulopathy  
		* 

### Ineffective Therapies

## Complications

Major complications include:

* Variceal bleeding
* Ascites
* Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
* Hepatic encephalopathy
* Hepatocellular carcinoma
* Hepatorenal syndrome
* Hepatopulmonary syndrome

## Prognosis
