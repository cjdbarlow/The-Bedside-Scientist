# Chronic Liver Disease

End result of a process of progressive destruction and regeneration of liver parenchyma, leading to fibrosis and cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is:

* A leading cause of death
* Greatly ↑ perioperative morbidity and mortality

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

Key pathophysiological processes relate impairment of key liver functions:

* Metabolic
	* Clearance of vasoactive mediators\
	Typically altered baseline haemodynamics:
		* ↑ CO
		* ↓ SVR
			* ↓ Vasopressor response
* Synthetic
	* Coagulopathy\
	↓ Synthesis of both procoagulant (predominantly II, V, VII, X) and anticoagulant (protein C, protein S, antithrombin III) factors leads to:
		* Highly deranged clotting studies
		* Variable *in vivo* clotting activity\
		Often normal behaviour in stable patients, but can easily become both prothrombotic or coagulopathic.

### Aetiology

Common causes include:

* Viral hepatitis  
	* Hepatitis B
	* Hepatitis C
* Autoimmune disease
* Alcoholic liver disease

Rarer causes include:

* Cholestasis
	* Primary biliary cirrhosis
	* Sclerosing cholangitis
* Vascular
	* Venous obstruction
	* Budd-Chiari syndrome
* Infiltrative
	* Amyloidosis
* Drugs
* Toxins
* Metabolic diseases
	* Wilson's Disease
	* Haemochromatosis
	* α1-antitrypsin

## Clinical Manifestations

Classified into:

* Hepatic
* Extrahepatic
	* Cardiac
		* Hepatopulmonary syndrome  
		Shunt due to pulmonary vasodilation in excess of ventilation, possibly due to ↓ hepatic clearance of endogenous vasodilators. 
		* Porto-pulmonary hypertension  
		Pulmonary hypertension (not due to left heart failure, i.e. ↑ PVR with a normal PCWP) in the setting of portal hypertension.
	* Endocrine
		* Secondary hyperaldosteronism
	* Renal
		* Hepatorenal syndrome  
	* GIT
		* Portal hypertension  
		Portal pressure **>10mmHg**. Leads to:
			* Collateral venous circulation
			* Ascites
			* Splenomegaly  
			Thrombocytopaenia due to sequestration.
			* Oesophageal varices
		* Delayed gastric emptying
	* Haematological
		* Anaemia  
		Multiple potential causes:
			* GIT bleeding
			* Hypersplenic haemolysis
			* Malnutrition
			* Anaemia of chronic disease
		* Coagulopathy


### MELD Score

Uses:

* Serum bilirubin
* Serum creatinine
* INR

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx


## Investigations

Bloods:

* FBE
	* Anaemia
	* Thrombocytopaenia
* Coagulation assays
	* PT  
	Prognostic indicator, especially post-surgery in CLD.
* UEC
	* Baseline renal function important

## Management

### Anaesthetic Considerations

:::caution
End-stage liver disease associated with high perioperative morbidity and mortality.
:::

* A
	* Aspiration risk  
	Due to delayed gastric emptying. Consider RSI.
* B
	* Presence of ascites or pleural effusions  
	Restrict alveolar ventilation, FRC, and predispose to atelectasis and hypoxia.
* C
	* Presence of alcoholic cardiomyopathy
	* Typically hyperdynamic circulation  
	High CO, low SVR.
* D
	* Wernicke's encephalopathy
	* Hepatic encephalopathy
* E
	* Neuromuscular blockade
		* Non-depolarising agents:
			* Require ↑ doses  
			Due to ↑ V~D~.
			* Aminosteroids have prolonged elimination
* H
	* Coagulopathy  


### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

## Complications

* B
	* Ascites
* C
	* Hepatopulmonary syndrome
* D
	* Hepatic encephalopathy
* F
	* Hepatorenal syndrome
* G
	* Variceal bleeding\
	May be precipitated by infection due to an ↑ in sinusoidal and portal venous pressure. Therefore, patients with **variceal bleeds should receive antibiotics**.
	* Ascites
	* Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
	* Hepatocellular carcinoma
	* Decompensation
* I
	* Sepsis\
	Infections are:
		* More common in patients with cirrhosis
			* Physical debilitation
			* Deconditioning
			* Malnourishment
			* ↓ Phagocytic function
		* Associated with higher mortality and morbidity\
		Up to 70% mortality. Higher incidence of sepsis associated:
			* AKI
			* Encephalopathy
			* Coagulopathy
		* The highest cause of death in cirrhotic patients

:::column-margin
Causative organisms (in order of likelihood) include:

* *E. Coli*
* *S. Aureus*
* *E. Faecalis*
* *S. Pneumoniae*
* *P. aeruginosa*
* *S. Epidermidis*
:::

### Hepatorenal Syndrome

Hepatorenal syndrome is an end-stage manifestation of worsening renal perfusion that occurs in portal hypertension. Hepatorenal syndrome is:

:::column-margin
Diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome essentially requires:

* Cirrhosis with ascites
* Renal impairment\
Without other cause, i.e. despite:
	* Diuretic withdrawal
	* Volume resuscitation
	* Nephrotoxin cessation
	* Absence of shock
	* Absence of parenchymal disease\
	No haematuria, proteinuria, normal sonographic appearance.
:::

* Divided into two subtypes
	* Type 1\
	Rapidly progressive.
	* Type 2\
	Progressive deterioration.
* Related to the progression of portal hypertension, rather than the progression of the hepatic lesion
* Occurs due to fall in renal perfusion pressure due to systemic vasodilation
	* Note that the kidneys are usually functional and intact\
	Renal function will return if portal hypertension is resolved (i.e. liver transplantation, or transplantation of the kidneys to a new host).
* Indicative of poor prognosis

Management:

* C
	* ↑ Renal perfusion
		* ↑ MAP
			* Noradrenaline
			* 20% Albumin
		* Terlipressin
		* Ascitic drainage\
		Relieve abdominal compartment syndrome.


## Prognosis


### Child-Pugh Score

:::info
This is included mostly for completeness, the Child-Pugh score is inferior to standard ICU scoring systems for outcome prediction.
\
MELD (see @sec-alfscoring) is equally poor in predicting outcome in the ICU patient.
:::

Score to assess prognosis of cirrhosis:

* Initially developed to predict perioperative mortality
* Validated for prognostication and to assess necessity of liver transplantation

| Value                          | 1 point  | 2 points                   | 3 points                       |
| ------------------------------ | -------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Total bilirubin** (μmol/L)   | ⩽34      | 34-50                      | ⩾50                            |
| **Serum albumin** (g/dL)       | ⩾3.5     | 2.8-3.5                    | ⩽2.8                           |
| **PT** (s)                     | ⩽4       | 4-6                        | ⩾6                             |
| **INR**                        | ⩽1.7     | 1.7-2.3                    | ⩾2.3                           |
| **Ascites**                    | None     | Mild/medically controlled  | Moderate to severe/refractory  |
| **Hepatic encephalopathy**     | None     | Grade I-II                 | Grade III-IV                   |

:::column-margin
There are many issues with the Child-Pugh score:

* Subjective assessments have inter-observer variability
* Evaluation of ascites has progressed since the '60s when the score was developed
* Excludes effects of concomitant disease

:::

Patients are then risk stratified as follows:

| Class  | Points  | One-year survival  |
| ------ | ------- | ------------------ |
| A      | 5-6     | 100%               |
| B      | 7-9     | 80%                |
| C      | 10-15   | 45%                |
