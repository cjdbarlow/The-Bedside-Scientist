# Acute Pancreatitis

Acute inflammation of the pancreas that is subclassified by severity into:

:::column-margin
The **Glasgow Criteria** are adverse prognostic factors:

* Admission
	* Age >55
	* WCC >16 1,000/mm^3^
	* Glucose >11 mmol/L
	* AST >250 U/L
* Within 48 hours
	* ↓ In Hct >10%
	* ↑ In urea >1.8 mmol/L
	* Calcium <2 mmol/L
	* PaO~2~ <60 mmHg
:::

* Mild acute pancreatitis\
No organ failure or complications.
* Moderate acute pancreatitis\
	* Transient (<48 hours) organ failure
	* Local complications\
	Peripancreatic fluid collections, which can be:
		* Necrosis\
		Non-viable pancreas that may be sterile or infected. Necrosis:
			* Usually develops early
			* Is established by 96 hours
			* Is a major prognostic factor.
		* Pseudocysts
		* Cysts
	* Systemic complications
* Severe acute pancreatitis\
As moderate, but with persistent single or multiorgan failure.


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

Precipitants include:

* Biliary obstruction\
35-40%.
	* **Gallstones**
	* Malignancy
* Drugs
	* **Alcohol**\
	35%.
	* Antibiotics
		* Metronidazole
		* Nitrofurantoin
		* Erythromycin
		* Tetracyclines
		* Sulphonamides
	* Diuretics
		* Furosemide
		* Thiazides
	* Toxins
		* Methyl alcohol
		* Scorpion venom
		* Organophosphates
* Metabolic
	* **Hyperlipidaemia**
	* Hypercalcaemia
		* Hyperparathyroidism
	* DKA
	* ESRD
* Infections
	* Viral
		* HIV
		* EBV
		* Mumps
	* Bacteria
		* Mycoplasma
		* Legionella
		* Campylobacter
	* Parasites
		* Ascariasis
* Immune
	* Polyarteritis nodosa
	* SLE
	* TTP
* Pregnancy
* Trauma
* Iatrogenic
	* Postoperative

An enjoyable mnemonic for some of these causes is:

* **I**diopathic\
\
* **G**all stones
* **E**thanol
* **T**rauma\
\
* **S**teroids
* **M**umps\
And other viruses.
* **A**utoimmune
* **S**corpions
* **H**yperlipidaemia
* **E**RCP
* **D**rugs

## Clinical Manifestations

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

Radiology:

* Contrast CT
	* Pancreatitis\
	Loss of normal contrast enhancement.
	* Necrosis
* Ultrasound
	* Usually limited by bowel gas
	* Cannot quantify necrosis
	* Provides assessment of biliary tree
	* May provide guidance for needle aspiration

## Management

:::info
Surgical management of pancreatitis is associated with very high mortality; treatment is supportive and surgical management should only be resorted to if it is otherwise unavoidable.
:::

**Resuscitation**:

* C
	* Volume resuscitation\
		* Aggressive volume resuscitation required for offsetting distributive shock and correcting hypovolaemia
		* >10mL/kg associated with ↑ ARDS and ↑ abdominal compartment syndrome
	* Haemodynamic support

**Specific therapy**:

:::column-margin
Carbapenems have exceptional penetration into pancreatic tissue, and are effective against most culprit organisms.
:::

* Pharmacological
	* Antibiotics\
		* Low threshold for IV antibiotics if suspecting infected collection
		* Prophylactic antimicrobials *may* have a role in severe disease
	* NSAIDs\
	Appropriate post-ERCP in mild gallstone pancreatitis as analgesics and may ↓ severity.
* Procedural
	* Feeding\
		* EN should be started once hyperacute inflammation ceases
		* PN indicated only if EN fails or is contraindicated\
		EN ↓ infection, organ failure, and mortality compared with PN.
		* NJ feeding may be preferable to NG to avoid ↑ pancreatic secretion
	* Open necrosectomy\
		* **Infected** collections should be managed **non-operatively** for **>4 weeks** to allow fibrous walls and liquefaction to occur
		* Indications for surgery usually are other abdominal complication, e.g.:
			* Perforation
			* Bleeding
			* Mesenteric ischaemia
	* Needle aspiration
	* Cholecystectomy\
	Indicated in gallstone pancreatitis due to high (up to 90%) rate of recurrence.
		* Mild cases can proceed immediately
		* More severe disease should be stabilised first
	* ERCP
		* ↓ Morbidity and mortality in **mild** gallstone pancreatitis

:::column-margin
Feeding:

* Maintains gut mucosal barrier
* Corrects nutritional deficiencies\
Many patients malnourished on presentation.
* ↓ Risk of secondary infection of necrotic pancreatic tissue
:::

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:

### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

Prophylactic antifungal therapy is not recommended.

Various therapies aimed at generally ↓ pancreatic exocrine function are without evidence, and include:

* Octreotide
* Somatostatin
* H~2~-antagonists
* Atropine
* Calcitonin
* Glucagon
* Fluorouracil


Interventions aimed to ↓ protease secretion are also without evidence, and include:

* Aprotinin
* Gabexate mesilate

## Anaesthetic Considerations

## Complications

* Death\
5-10% mortality in severe disease.
* B
	* ARDS
* C
	* Shock
		* Distributive
		* Hypovolaemic
* G
	* Abdominal compartment syndrome
	* Pancreatic cysts\
	Do not merit surgical intervention unless:
		* Gastric outflow obstruction
		* Biliary obstruction
	* Pancreatic abscess\
	Infected collections are a major contributor to morbidity and mortality.
		* Usually arise 4 weeks after severe pancreatitis
		* Amenable to percutaneous drainage

## Prognosis

Poor prognostic signs:

* Pancreatic necrosis
	* Pancreatic head necrosis is as severe as whole pancreatic necrosis
	* Pancreatic tail necrosis usually has a good prognosis
