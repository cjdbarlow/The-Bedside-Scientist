# Acute Kidney Injury 

A spectrum of acute glomerular dysfunction characterised by a ↓ UO and ↑ serum creatinine and urea, and defined by the KDIGO classification as an:

:::column-margin
Noting that KDIGO is an imperfect definition: not all AKI will fit into this criteria, and not all cases fitting the criteria are true AKI.
:::

* **↑** In serum creatinine\
	* Best overall index of renal function
		* Independently associated with ↑ mortality\
		Larger rises in creatinine are correlated with poorer survival
		* Absolute rises are less accurate in patients with pre-existing renal impairment as an absolute change in GFR will cause a variable change in creatinine
	* Only rises once ~50% of GFR is lost\
	This can become apparent where a patient with normal premorbid renal function develops an AKI after a relatively trivial physiological insult.
	* Lags with respect to "true" GFR, so does not reflect dynamic changes
* **↓** In **urine output**\
UO is a reasonably sensitive but not specific index of kidney function.
	* A significant ↓ in GFR immediately results in ↓ UO, however serum creatinine will not rise for several hours
	* Volume depletion and hypotension stimulate vasopressin secretion and water reabsorption
	* Polyuria may occur when tubular function is impaired, even if hypovolaemic\
	Impaired concentration of urine in the loop causes **non-oliguric renal failure**.
	* Ideal body weight should be used instead of actual body weight in the obese population for UO calculation
* Diagnosis is more complex in the critically ill due to lack of steady-state conditions, variable rate of creatinine production, and variable rate of elimination

: The KDIGO Classification


:::column-margin
On **Acute tubular necrosis**:

* The term ATN is often used to describe the intrinsic renal injury that occurs following a persistent pre-renal insult
* This is probably not correct, as the histology of tubular necrosis is not confirmed in this population
* In animal models, necrosis of the PCT (and occasionally DCT) occurs when blood flow is adequate to maintain tubular perfusion but not glomerular filtration, and is believed to be a form of ischaemia-reperfusion injury
* 'True' ATN may occur following arterial occlusion (such as AAA rupture or dissection)
:::

Risk factors:

* Occurs in:
	* 7% of hospital inpatients
	* Up to 25% of ICU patients

		* Nephrotoxic drugs
		* Toxins
	* Perioperative
		* Trauma
		* Major surgery
			* Cardiac surgery
				* ↑ with CPB

## Pathophysiology

Pathophysiology varies by aetiology, which are generally classified into:

* Pre-renal\
40-70% of AKI.
* Intra-renal\
10-50% of AKI.
* Post-renal\
10% of AKI in ICU patients, but the most common cause in the general population.

:::column-margin
Most common causes in the critically ill are:

* Sepsis
* Heart failure
* HDx instability
* Hypovolaemia
* Nephrotoxins
:::

### Pre-Renal

Renal dysfunction due to extra-renal factors, resulting in decreased perfusion. Rapid correction of the systemic cause usually results in rapid renal recovery.

Causes can be divided into:

* Hypovolaemia
	* Haemorrhage
	* Vomiting/Diarrhoea
	* Inappropriate diuresis
	* Burns
* Hypotensive/low flow
	* Shock states
	* AAA
	* Renal artery stenosis
	* Hepatorenal syndrome
* Impaired autoregulation
	* NSAIDS
	* ACE-Is/ARBs
* Oedema
	* Cardiac failure
	* Cirrhosis
	* Nephrotic syndrome

### Intra-Renal

Disease of the renal parenchyma, with structural changes visible on biopsy. Causes include:

* Glomerular disease
	* Inflammatory
		* Post-infective GN
		* Henoch-Schonlein Purpura
		* SLE
		* Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated GN
		* Antiglomerular basement membrane disease
* Interstitial nephritis
	* Drugs
		* NSAID
		* Aminoglycosides
		* Radiological contrast\
		It is theorised that osmotic stress and direct tubular toxic effects lead to renal tubular injury, and may cause acute tubular necrosis.
			* Typically, acute contrast nephropathy is benign, with creatinine returning to baseline within 10-14 days\
			* There is significant uncertainty as to whether contrast media do cause acute kidney injury\
			*If* this risk is present, it is probably only relevant in patients who have:
				* Impaired renal function
				* Arterial contrast
			* Rehydration and volume correction are effective in preventing a rise in creatinine
	* Infiltrative disease
		* Lymphoma
		* Granulomatous disease
			* Sarcoidosis
			* Tuberculosis
		* Infection
			* Pyelonephritis
* Tubular injury\
Typically due to continuation of pre-renal causes.
	* Ischaemia
	* Toxins
		* Drugs
		* Myoglobin
		* Heavy metals
	* Metabolic
		* Hypercalcaemia
		* Immunoglobulins
	* Crystals
		* Urate
		* Oxalate
* Vascular
	* Vasculitis
	* Cryoglobulinaemia
	* Polyarteritis Nodosa
	* Thrombotic microangiopathy
	* Cholesterol emboli
	* Renal artery/renal vein thrombosis

### Post-renal

Divided into:

* Intraluminal
	* Urinary retention
	* Stone
	* Clot
* Intramural
	* Urethral stricture
	* Prostatic hypertrophy
	* Tumour
* Extramural
	* Malignancy


## Clinical Manifestations


## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

1. Is this acute or chronic?
	* Previous creatinine measurements
	* Chronicity suggested by:
		* Symptom duration
		* Nocturia
		* Anaemia
		* Hyperphosphataemia
		* Hypocalcaemia
2. Is there ↓ renal perfusion?
	* Volume status?
	* Cardiac insufficiency?
	* Renal vasoconstriction
3. Is there obstruction?
	* Ultrasound
		* Bladder
		* Renal tract
	* Palpable bladder
4. Is there other evidence or concern for renal parenchymal disease?
	* Rashes
	* Arthralgia
	* Myalgia
	* Haematuria
5. Is there vascular occlusion?

## Investigations

Urinary tract ultrasound:

* For diagnosis of obstruction


Serology:

* Creatinine
	* Normal daily variation in SCr is ~10%
	* Measurements are affected by:
		* Volume state (as it is measured as a concentration)
		* 
	* Ideally, results from the same lab should be used
* Urea


Urinalysis:

* Sodium and osmolality
	* Healthy kidneys respond to hypovolaemia/hypoperfusion by ↑ urinary osmolarity and reducing sodium, urea, and water excretion\
	This response may be impaired in disease, as well as due to drugs and other therapies (such as CPB).
	* Low urine osmolality may indicate impaired tubular function
	* High osmolality and low sodium with uraemia and oliguria suggests intact tubular function\
* Renal tubular cells\
Tubular disease.
* Red cell casts/dysmorphic red cells\
Indicate glomerular disease.
* Oxalate crystals\
Ethylene glycol poisoning.
* Urate crystals\
Tumour lysis syndrome.
* Urinary light chains


Other:

* Intrabdominal pressure measurement\
For evaluation of abdominal compartment syndrome.
	* Urinary pressure >20mmHg suggests compartment syndrome causing AKI
* Autoimmune profile\
ANCA, ANA, C3, C4. Perform in patients with:
	* Pulmonary-Renal Syndrome
	* Haemoptysis
	* Haemolysis
	* Thrombocytopaenia
* Renal biopsy


## Management

### Preventative

Principles:

* Maintain renal perfusion
	* Maintain intravascular volume
	* Correct anaemia
	* Maintain renal perfusion pressure33eee


General considerations:

* Maintain MAP 65-90mmHg
	* Consider higher MAP targets in patients with hypertension
	* Vasopressors and fluids
* Maintain volume status
	* Crystalloid > colloid
* Avoid nephrotoxins
	* Avoid aminoglycosides unless no other alternatives are available\
	If used:
		* Administer as single daily dose
		* Monitor levels when used for >48 hours
	* Use lipid formulations of amphotericin B
	* Use azoles or echinocandins as alternatives to amphotericin B if able
	* IV contrast


Perioperative considerations:

* Meticulous fluid management
* Cardiac output and blood pressure control

### Supportive

* Avoid hyperglycaemia
	* Use IV insulin to maintain BSL 6-8 mmol/L
* Maintain 20-30 kcal/kg/day of energy intake\
Enteric route if possible.
* Avoid protein restriction


### Corrective

* Identify and remove precipitating factors
	* Cease nephrotoxins
	* Maintain perfusing MAP with crystalloid and pressors
* Consider invasive monitoring
* Identify and treat complications

* Dialysis
	* No mortality difference between IHD and CRRT, but CRRT is less likely to cause hypotension

### Dialysis

*Dialysis is covered in detail [here](/management/renal/rrt.md).*


Renal replacement therapy is:

* Indicated for life-threatening:
	* Volume overload
	* Electrolyte disturbance
	* Acidosis
	* Uraemia\
	Typically initiated for uraemia prior to onset of uraemic complications.
		* Uraemic pericarditis
		* Encephalopathy
		* Coagulopathy
	* Toxins
* Aimed at:
	* Maintaining electrolyte, solute, and acid-base homeostasis
	* Preventing further renal insult
	* Permitting renal recover
	* Facilitate delivery of other supportive measures
* Not (necessarily) indicated by creatinine and urea values alone
* Ceased when:
	* Intrinsic kidney function has recovered\
	Mean duration ~12 days.
	* Not consistent with goals of care




Technique:

* CRRT has greater haemodynamic stability than IHD\
CRRT is preferred in patients with:
	* Haemodynamic instability
	* High ICPs, brain oedema
* Bicarbonate solutions are preferred over lactate solutions, *especially* in:
	* Shock
	* Hepatic failure
	* Lactic acidosis
* CRRT effluent volume should be 20-25ml/hr\
This typically requires a prescription of 25-30ml/hr due to interruptions.
	* Hypotension and electrolyte disturbances are more common at higher intensities and are not associated with 
* RRT efficiency (Kt/V = Intensity/V~D~) should be 3.9
	* Note that V~D~ is dynamic in the critically ill
	* Therefore Kt/V is typically estimated using effluent flow rate



### Ineffective Treatments

* Loop diuretics\
Reduce volume but do not affect survival or renal recovery.
	* Theoretically reduce oxygen consumption in loop of Henle and therefore lessen ischaemic injury\
	Minimal supportive evidence outweighed by evidence of harm.
	* **Appropriate to treat volume overload in the setting of AKI, but not AKI itself**
	* Ineffective in reducing frequency or duration of RRT
	* ⩾1g/day of frusemide may cause ototoxicity
* Mannitol\
Likely no benefit.
* Dopamine\
No evidence of benefit, some evidence of harm.
* Natriuretic peptides (e.g. ANP) \
No benefit.
* Fenoldopam\
No benefit.
* (rh)IGF-1\
No benefit.
* NAC


## Complications

Major complications:

* Death\
	* Perioperative mortality over 50%
* Sepsis
* Organ dysfunction


Physiological derangements:

* Volume overload
* Metabolic acidosis
* Hyperkalaemia
* Uraemia
	* Platelet dysfunction
	* Pericarditis
	* Encephalopathy
