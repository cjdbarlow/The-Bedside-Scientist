# Acute Kidney Injury 


AKI describes a syndrome of acute changes in renal function. AKI describes:

* Both renal injury and renal impairment relative to physiological demand  
This definition is useful as it correlates with mortality.
	* Encompasses both ATN and ARF
* Specific and non-specific kidney diseases  
Multiple of which may coexist within one patient.
* A clinical syndrome consisting of a **rapid decrease in GFR, with concomitant rise in creatinine and urea**  
The KDIGO classification defines (noting that not all AKI will fit into this criteria, and not all cases fitting the criteria are true AKI) as:  
	* **Increase** in serum **creatinine >26.5 μmol/L** within 48 hours  
	Creatinine and GFR are the best overall index of renal function.
		* This increase is independently associated with increased mortality
		* Larger rises in creatinine are correlated with poorer survival
	* **Increase** in serum **creatinine >1.5x baseline** in the last 7 days  
	Absolute rises are less accurate in patients with pre-existing renal impairment as an absolute change in GFR will cause a variable change in creatinine. 
	* **Urine volume < 0.5ml/kg/hr** for 6 hours  
	Urine output is a reasonably sensitive but not specific index of kidney function.
		* A significant fall in GFR will immediately result in decreased urine output, however serum creatinine will not rise for several hours
		* Volume depletion and hypotension stimulate vasopressin secretion and water reabsorption
		* Polyuria may occur when tubular function is impaired  
		Impaired concentration of urine in the loop causes **non-oliguric renal failure**.
		* Ideal body weight should be used instead of actual body weight in the obese population
* Diagnosis is more complex in the critically ill due to lack of steady-state conditions, variable rate of creatinine production, and variable rate of elimination

The KDIGO classification stages AKI as follows:

|Stage|Creatinine|Urine Output|
|---|---|
|1|1.5-1.9x baseline OR<br> ⩾26.5 μmol/L increase in Cr|⩽0.5ml/kg/hr for 6-12 hours|
|2|2-2.9x baseline|⩽0.5ml/kg/hr for ⩾12 hours|
|3|3x baseline OR<br> Cr ⩾354μmol/L OR<br> Initiation of RRT OR<br> eGFR ⩽35ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> in children|⩽0.3ml/kg/hr for ⩾24 hours OR<br> Anuria > 12 hours|


**Acute tubular necrosis**:

* Clinical syndrome where blood flow is adequate to maintain tubular perfusion but not glomerular filtration
	* Classically believed to be necrosis of the PCT (and occasionally DCT) following ischaemia-reperfusion injury  
	This is demonstrated in animal models but does not correlate with syndrome typically labelled ATN in humans.
		* 'True' ATN may occur following arterial occlusion (such as AAA rupture or dissection)


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Risk factors:

* Occurs in:
	* 7% of hospital inpatients
	* Up to 25% of ICU patients

		* Critical illness
		* Shock
		* Burns
		* Nephrotoxic drugs
		* Toxins
	* Perioperative
		* Trauma
		* Major surgery
			* Cardiac surgery
				* Increased with CPB

## Pathophysiology

Causes are generally classified into:

* **Pre-renal**  
40-70% of AKI. Can be divided into:
	* Hypovolaemia
		* Haemorrhage
		* Vomiting/Diarrhoea
		* Inappropriate diuresis
		* Burns
	* Hypotensive causes
		* Shock states
		* AAA
		* Renal artery stenosis
		* Hepatorenal syndrome
	* Impaired autoregulation
		* NSAIDS
		* ACE-Is/ARBs
	* Oedema
		* Cardiac failure
		* Cirrhosis
		* Nephrotic syndrome 
* **Intra-renal**  
10-50% of AKI. Can be divided into:
	* Glomerular disease
		* Inflammatory
			* Post-infectie GN
			* Henoch-Schonlein Purpura
			* SLE
			* Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated GN
			* Antiglomerular basement membrane disease
	* Interstitial nephritis
		* Drugs
			* NSAID
			* Aminoglycosides
			* Radiological contrast  
			It is theorised that osmotic stress and direct tubular toxic effects lead to renal tubular injury, and may cause acute tubular necrosis.
				* Typically, acute contrast nephropathy is benign, with creatinine returning to baseline within 10-14 days  
				* There is significant uncertainty as to whether contrast media do cause acute kidney injury  
				*If* this risk is present, it is probably only relevant in patients who have:
					* Impaired renal function
					* Arterial contrast
				* Rehydration and volume correction are effective in preventing a rise in creatinine
		* Infiltrative disease
			* Lymphoma
			* Granulomatous disease
				* Sarcoidosis
				* Tuberculosis
			* Infection
				* Pyelonephritis
	* Tubular injury  
	Typically due to continuation of pre-renal causes.
		* Ischaemia
		* Toxins
			* Drugs
			* Myoglobin
			* Heavy metals
		* Metabolic
			* Hypercalcaemia
			* Immunoglobulins
		* Crystals
			* Urate
			* Oxalate
	* Vascular
		* Vasculitis
		* Cryoglobulinaemia
		* Polyarteritis Nodosa
		* Thrombotic microangiopathy
		* Cholesterol emboli
		* Renal artery/renal vein thrombosis
* **Post-renal**  
10% of AKI. May be divided into:
	* Intraluminal
		* Urinary retention
		* Stone
		* Clot
	* Intramural
		* Stricture
		* Prostatic hypertrophy
		* Tumour
	* Extramural
		* Malignancy

Most common causes in the critically ill are:

* Sepsis
* Heart failure
* HDx instability
* Hypovolaemia
* Nephrotoxins


## Clinical Manifestations



## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

1. Is this acute or chronic?
	* Previous creatinine measurements
	* Chronicity suggested by:
		* Symptom duration
		* Nocturia
		* Anaemia
		* Hyperphosphataemia
		* Hypocalcaemia
2. Is there decreased renal perfusion?
	* Volume status?
	* Cardiac insufficiency?
	* Renal vasoconstriction
3. Is there obstruction?
	* Ultrasound
		* Bladder
		* Renal tract
	* Palpable bladder
4. Is there other evidence or concern for renal parenchymal disease?
	* Rashes
	* Arthralgia
	* Myalgia
	* Haematuria
5. Is there vascular occlusion?

## Investigations

Urinary tract ultrasound:

* For diagnosis of obstruction


Serology:

* Creatinine
	* Normal daily variation in SCr is ~10%
	* Measurements are affected by:
		* Volume state (as it is measured as a concentration)
		* 
	* Ideally, results from the same lab should be used



Urinalysis:

* Sodium and osmolality
	* Healthy kidneys respont to hypovolaemia/hypoperfusion by increasing urinary osmolarity and reducing sodium, urea, and water excretion  
	This response may be impaired in disease, as well as due to drugs and other therapies (such as CPB).
	* Low urine osmolality may indicate impaired tubular function
	* High osmolality and low sodium with uraemia and oliguria suggests intact tubular function  
* Renal tubular cells  
Tubular disease.
* Red cell casts/dysmorphic red cells  
Indicate glomerular disease.
* Oxalate crystals  
Ethylene glycol poisoning.
* Urate crystals  
Tumour lysis syndrome.
* Urinary light chains


Other:

* Intrabdominal pressure measurement  
For evaluation of abdominal compartment syndrome.
	* Urinary pressure >20mmHg suggests compartment syndrome causing AKI
* Autoimmune profile  
ANCA, ANA, C3, C4. Perform in patients with:
	* Pulmonary-Renal Syndrome
	* Haemoptysis
	* Haemolysis
	* Thrombocytopaenia
* Renal biopsy


## Management

### Preventative

Principles:

* Maintain renal perfusion


General considerations:

* Maintain MAP 65-90mmHg
	* Consider higher MAP targets in patients with hypertension
	* Vasopressors and fluids
* Maintain volume status
	* Cystalloid > colloid
* Avoid nephrotoxins
	* Avoid aminoglycosides unless no other alternatives are available  
	If used:
		* Administer as single daily dose
		* Monitor levels when used for >48 hours
	* Use lipid formulations of amphotericin B
	* Use azoles or echinocandins as alternatives to amphotericin B if able
	* IV contrast


Perioperative considerations:

* Meticulous fluid management
* Cardiac output and blood pressure control

### Supportive

* Avoid hyperglycaemia
	* Use IV insulin to maintain BSL 6-8 mmol/L
* Maintain 20-30 kcal/kg/day of energy intake  
Enteric route if possible.
* Avoid protein restriction


### Corrective

* Identify and remove precipitating factors
	* Cease nephrotoxins
	* Maintain perfusing MAP with crystalloid and pressors
* Consider invasive monitoring
* Identify and treat complications

* Dialysis
	* No mortality difference between IHD and CRRT, but CRRT is less likely to cause hypotension

### Dialysis

*Dialysis is covered in detail [here](/management/renal/rrt.md).*


Renal replacement therapy is:

* Indicated for life-threatening:
	* Volume overload
	* Electrolyte disturbance
	* Acidosis
	* Uraemia  
	Typically initiated for uraemia prior to onset of uraemic complications.
		* Uraemic pericarditis
		* Encephalopathy
		* Coagulopathy
	* Toxins
* Aimed at:
	* Maintaining electrolyte, solute, and acid-base homeostasis
	* Preventing further renal insult
	* Permitting renal recover
	* Facilitate delivery of other supportive measures
* Not (necessarily) indicated by creatinine and urea values alone
* Ceased when:
	* Intrinsic kidney function has recovered  
	Mean duration ~12 days.
	* Not consistent with goals of care




Technique:

* CRRT has greater haemodynamic stability than IHD  
CRRT is preferred in patients with:
	* Haemodynamic instability
	* High ICPs, brain oedema
* Bicarbonate solutions are preferred over lactate solutions, *especially* in:
	* Shock
	* Hepatic failure
	* Lactic acidosis
* CRRT effluent volume should be 20-25ml/hr  
This typically requires a prescription of 25-30ml/hr due to interruptions.
	* Hypotension and electrolyte disturbances are more common at higher intensities and are not associated with 
* RRT efficiency (Kt/V = Intensity/V<sub>D</sub>) should be 3.9
	* Note that V<sub>D</sub> is dynamic in the critically ill
	* Therefore Kt/V is typically estimated using effluent flow rate



### Ineffective Treatments

* Loop diuretics  
Reduce volume but do not affect survival or renal recovery.
	* Theoretically reduce oxygen consumption in loop of Henle and therefore lessen ischaemic injury  
	Minimal supportive evidence outweighed by evidence of harm.
	* **Appropriate to treat volume overload in the setting of AKI, but not AKI itself**
	* Ineffective in reducing frequency or duration of RRT
	* ⩾1g/day of frusemide may cause ototoxicity
* Mannitol  
Likely no benefit.
* Dopamine  
No evidence of benefit, some evidence of harm.
* Natriuretic peptides (e.g. ANP)   
No benefit.
* Fenoldopam  
No benefit.
* (rh)IGF-1  
No benefit.
* NAC


## Complications

Major complications:

* Death  
	* Perioperative mortality over 50%
* Sepsis
* Organ dysfunction


Physiological derangements:

* Volume overload
* Metabolic acidosis
* Hyperkalaemia
* Uraemia
	* Platelet dysfunction
	* Pericarditis
	* Encephalopathy
