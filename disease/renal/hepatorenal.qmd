# Hepatorenal Syndrome

Form of pre-renal failure which:

* Occurs in the setting of severe chronic liver disease\
Usually with portal hypertension.
* Is unresponsive to fluid therapy


## Pathophysiology

* Hepatic dysfunction leads to drastic splanchnic NO overproduction and splanchnic vasodilation
Circulating volume is sequestered in the dilated splanchnic circulation.
* RAAS activation occurs in the setting of apparent hypovolaemia
	* ↑ Renin constricts afferent arteriole and ↓ renal perfusion
	* Systemic vasoconstrictor release does not overcome splanchnic NO production\
		* There is a global **↓** in **SVR** and ↑ in CO
		* Progressively more volume is sequestered in the splanchnic circulation
		* Renal perfusion suffers due to ↓ SVR and ↑ afferent arteriolar constriction
* Ascites\
High volume ascites contributes to ↑ IAP and compression of the kidney.

### Aetiology

Often insidious, but acute decline is usually precipitated by another renal-failure inducing event:

The difference between "AKI secondary to hypovolaemia/NSAID/etc" and "hepatorenal syndrome secondary to hypovolaemia" is the **reversibility**.
\
If the AKI recovers after volume administration, then it was standard pre-renal failure; if it doesn't, then it's hepatorenal syndrome.

* Volume loss
	* Large paracentesis without albumin replacement
	* Diuresis
	* Bleeding
* Infection
	* SBP
	* Sepsis
* Nephrotoxins

## Clinical Manifestations

Constellation of:

* Biochemical renal failure
* Minimal proteinuria
* Low sodium excretion\
Urinary Na <10mmol/L.
* Oliguria or normal urine output\
Especially early.

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

Diagnosis requires all of:

* Renal failure
	* Creatinine >150mmol/L
	* Non-responsive to fluid and albumin resuscitation
* Chronic liver disease
	* Ascites
	* Cirrhosis
* Absence of another cause:
	* Nephrotoxins
	* Intra-renal disease\
	i.e. No:L
		* Proteinuria
		* Microhaematuria
		* Sonoanatomical renal abnormality


Other differentials include:

* Pre-renal failure
	* Cessation of beta-blockade
* ATN


## Management

**Resuscitation**:\

Focuses on the restoration of renal blood flow and renal perfusion pressure:

* Volume\
Classically albumin.
* Systemic vasoconstrictors\
Aim ↑ MAP by 10-15mmHg above presentation (at least >80mmHg).
	* Discontinue anti-hypertensives
	* Predominantly noradrenaline
	* Midodrine safe and effective
* Splanchnic vasoconstrictors
	* Terlipressin\
	1-2mg IV Q4-6H.
	* Octreotide\
	100ug SC Q8H or 50ug/hr IV infusion.


**Specific therapy**:

* TIPS\
↓ Ascites production.
* Liver transplantation


## Prognosis

Indicative of very high mortality without liver transplantation.
