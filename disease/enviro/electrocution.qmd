# Electrical Injury

Electrocution causes a variety of injury patterns depending on the:

* **Current size**\
Determined by:
	* Current **source**
		* **AC**\
		Maximal risk at ~50-60Hz.
			* Low-voltage\
			Typically at homes or offices.
				* May cause loss of consciousness
			* High-voltage\
			Typically industrial.
				* Extensive thermal burns
				* Violent muscle contraction may cause further injury
		* **DC**\
			* Violent muscle contraction may cause further injury
			* Much less likely to cause VF than AC current
		* **Conducted electrical weapons**\
		Typically tasers, and similar devices. 
			* Injuries due to consequences of the shock\
			e.g. Falls.
		* **Lightning strike**\
		Very high voltage, *short duration* static electrical discharge.
	* Tissue **resistance**\
	Significant determinant of injury.
		* **Wet skin** has **1000 times less resistance** than dry skin
		* Medical devices that breach skin (e.g. IV lines) significantly ↑ susceptibility
		* Classified into two types based on **ability to induce VF**:
			* Microshock\
			Induce VF when applied directly to myocardium; typically ~1ma.
			* Macroshock\
			Induce VF on surface contact; typically ~100mA.
* **Current duration**\

Causes of microshock include:

* Pacing wires
* Pulmonary artery catheters
* Central lines
* Arterial lines
* IV lines
* Static shock from staff

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Risks:

* Majority occur in:
	* Workplace\
	60%.
	* Home\
	50%.
		* Children <6 at highest risk
* Powerlines
* Electrified railway tracks

: Effects of Electrocution by Source

:::column-margin
**Leakage currents** are low-amperage currents that flow to earth due to imperfect insulation or coupling between electrical and magnetic fields around an AC source.\
\
They are generally harmless, but have capacity to cause microshock.

## Clinical Features

Injuries can occur due to:

* Depolarisation of **muscle** cells\
	* **Cardiac**
		* VF
		* Asystole
	* **Skeletal** muscle
		* Violent movement
		* Tetanic contraction
			* Prevents letting go
			* May prevent respiration due to tetanic diaphragmatic or intercostal contraction
* Vascular injury
	* Thrombosis\
	↑ Risk of small vessel injury.
* **Neurological injury**\
Due to:
	* Cardiorespiratory arrest
	* Direct injury\
	Current passing through brain.
	* Secondary trauma
* **Burns**\
May be extensive and include:
	* External electrical burns from arcs
	* Internal burns due to tissue heating
	* Thermal burns from heated jewelery or flammable clothes
	* Flash burns
