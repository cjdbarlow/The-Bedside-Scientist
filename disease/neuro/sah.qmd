# Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Haemorrhage

 
Subarachnoid haemorrhage is a neurological emergency. SAH:

* May be:
	* Aneurysmal  
	Form of haemorrhagic stroke.
		* Accounts for 3% of all strokes
	* Traumatic
	* Other  
		* AVM
		* Fistulae
		* Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome.


Grading:

* Many grading scales exist:

* The WFNS scale assists prognosis and determining post-operative destination
* The Modified Fischer scale predicts vasospasm risk

| Grade | WFNS                        | Hunt & Hess                                                       | Modified Fisher        |
| --    | --                          | --                                                                | --                     |
| **1** | GCS 15                      | Mild headache, no or minimal nuchal rigidity                      | No SAH or IVH          |
| **2** | GCS 13-14, no motor deficit | Moderate to severe headache, nuchal rigidity, may have CN deficit | Thin SAH, no IVH       |
| **3** | GCS 13-14, motor deficit    | Confusion or lethargy, with or without mild focal deficit         | Thin SAH, IVH present  |
| **4** | GCS 7-12                    | Stuporous, severe focal deficit                                   | Thick SAH, no IVH      |
| **5** | GCS 3-6                     | Comatose, posturing or no motor response                          | Thick SAH, IVH present |

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Aneurysmal SAH:

* Occurs in ~9/100,000
* Has a high mortality rate
	* 15% prehospital
	* 30% 30-day
* 40% make a good recovery  
Prognostication:
	* Age
	* Conscious state
	* Blood volume
* Risk factors include:
	* Patient
		* Age
		* Female
		* Smoking
		* Heavy ETOH use
		* Sympathomimetic drug use
	* Disease
		* HTN
		* PHx SAH
		* FHx SAH
		* Polycystic kidney disease
		* Type IV Ehlers-Danlos syndrome

## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

## Clinical Manifestations

Typical presentation of:

* Sudden, severe headache  
	* "Worst headache of life"
	* Different from usual headaches
* Often associated with:
	* Loss of consciousness
	* Nausea
	* Vomiting
	* Photophobia
	* Neck pain


Headache may occur without symptoms, and patients may not seek medical attention or be misdiagnosed.

Assessment:

* GCS
* Meningeal irritation
* Focal neurology
* Fundoscopy  
May identify intraocular haemorrhage, which occurs in ~40% of cases.


## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

Imaging:

* Non-contrast CT head  
Sensitivity ↑ from 93% to 100% over 6 hours, and falls to 60% over the next 7 days.
* CTA  
First-line vascular imaging to identify source, though may miss aneurysms ⩽4mm.
* MRI  
May be slightly superior to CT.
* DSA  
Gold-standard for vascular imaging, and facilitates treatment.
* Transcranial Doppler  
Used to monitor for vasospasm.
	* Suggested by a Lindegaard ratio >3  
	Mean velocity in the MCA/mean velocity in ipsilateral ICA.

Lumbar puncture:

* Recommended if negative or equivocal CT in the setting of high clinical suspicion
* Method:
	* Opening pressures
	* CSF collection in 4 consecutive tubes  
	RBC can be measured consecutively to exclude traumatic tap.
	* Xanthochromia  
	By visual inspection; may take 12 hours to develop.
	* Spectrophotometry  
	Superior to visual inspection.


## Management

Control and stabilise
* Secure airway if required


Avoid rebleeding:

* Aggressive BP control to **SBP ≤160mmHg**  
Adjust target based on premorbid baseline BP.
	* Agents should preferably be given by infusion, and include:
		* Labetalol 5-20mg/hr
	* Short-acting opioids for analgesia
		* Dexamethasone can be considered for meningeal irritation
	* Avoid hypotension
	* Maintain euvolaemia  
	Avoid hypervolaemia.
* Consider antifibrinolytics  
For up to 72 hours, prior to aneurysm repair.


Secure aneurysm:

* Transfer to high-volume aneurysm centre for securing of aneurysm  
* Clip or coil depending on location and characteristics
	* Clipping  
	Favoured for aneurysms:
		* From the MCA
		* With a wide neck:body ratio
		* With crucial arteries from aneurysm dome
		* With a large parenchymal haematoma


Neurocritical care to prevent and manage complications:

* Delayed cerebral ischaemia
	* Nimodipine 60mg Q4H PO should be administered to all SAH patients for 21 days
		* Improves outcome but does not appear to reduce radiological vasospasm  
		Neuroprotection probably by another mechanism.
	* Repeat CT should occur at 24-48 hours to identify any new infarctions  
	Those not attributable to EVD or IPH should be considered to be due to delayed cerebral ischaemia.
	* Consider regular transcranial doppler to monitor for vasospasm
	* Patients with suspected vasospasm should have induced hypertension  
	Usually results in SBP 180-200mmHg. Depending on preference for MAP or SBP targets, consider aiming:
		* MAP 20mmHg above baseline
		* SBP 20-40mmHg above baseline
	* Consider intraarterial vasodilators or angioplasty for vasospasm-related delayed cerebral ischaemia
* Seizures  
	* Consider prophylactic anticonvulsants  
	Restrict to a short course.
	* Consider continuous EEG monitoring in patients who
		* Have a poor grade of SAH
		* Fail to improve
* Temperature control  
Target normothermia, with aggressiveness based on risk of delayed cerebral ischaemia.
* Glucose control  
Careful control with strict avoidance of hypoglycaemia.
* Anaemia  
Hb level should be maintained at 80-100g/L.
* Hyponatraemia  
Treat early with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone.
* DVT prophylaxis  
UFH should be considered 24 hours after securing of aneurysm. 


### Anaesthetic Considerations

### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

Prophylactic 'triple-H' therapy:

* Not recommended due to lack of efficacy
* Consists of:
	* Hypervolaemia
	* Hypertension
	* Haemodilution  
	Theorised to improve laminar flow and ↑ overall DO~2~.

## Complications

Rebleeding:

* Major life-threatening complication
	* 20-60% mortality
	* Usually occurs within 72 hours  
	Majority (50-90%) within 6 hours.


Hydrocephalus:

* Occurs in 20% of patients  
Within minutes to hours of onset.
* Symptoms include:
	* ↓ conscious state
	* Impaired upward gaze
	* Hypertension
	* Delirium
* Diagnosis on CT
* Managed with EVD


Epilepsy:

* Occurs in 2% of patients  
Correlated with severity.


Myocardial injury:

* LV dysfunction in 10-30%
* Related to catecholamine surge  
May lead to myocardial necrosis.
* Neurocardiogenic shock/Takotsubo cardiomyopathy may arise due to combination of ↑ preload and afterload (catecholamines), and ↓ inotropy (necrosis)

Delayed cerebral ischaemia:

* Defined as **any neurological deterioration** lasting **more than one hour** and **cannot be explained** by any other condition
* Leading cause of neurological morbidity  
Via cerebral infarction.
* Mechanisms include:
	* Vasospasm
	* Microcirculatory dysfunction
	* Microthrombosis
	* Cortical spreading depolarisation
	* Neuro-inflammation
* Associated with:
	* High serum catecholamine levels
	* Elevated serum lactate
* Leads to both:
	* Neurological complications:
		* Seizures
		* Infection
		* Cerebral oedema
	* Systemic complications:
		* Infection
		* Fever
		* APO
		* Cardiac failure
