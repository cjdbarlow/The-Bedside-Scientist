# Critical Illness Weakness

Combination of myopathy and neuropathy that occurs in the ICU patient, that is:

:::column-margin
Formal diagnosis of CIN/CIM requires electrophysiology studies, which are rarely performed in practice and are predominantly a research tool. Criteria include:

* CIN
	* ↓ AP amplitude\
	⩾2 nerves have amplitude <80% LLN for both:
		* Compound muscle
		* Sensory nerve
	* Normal nerve conduction velocity
	* No change on repetitive stimulation
* CIM
	* Preserved sensory nerve function
	* ↓ Muscle excitability in ⩾2 muscle groups
:::


* Characterised by:
	* Proximal myopathy
	* Symmetrical flaccid weakness
	* Hyporeflexia
* Subdivided into Critical Illness:
	* **Myopathy**\
	Almost universal in the critically ill, and contributes to the majority of ICU acquired weakness. 
	* **Neuropathy**\
	Rarer than CIM.
	* **Neuromyopathy**\
	Combination of neuropathy and myopathy.


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Weakness is common in ICU patients:

* 65% of patients after 5-7 days of ventilation


Risk factors relate predominantly to ↓ muscle mass:

:::column-margin
Patient factors have substantial overlap, are mutually reinforcing, and could broadly be summarised as **frailty**.
:::

* Patient factors
	* Age
	* Low-baseline muscle mass
	* Chronic disease
* Disease factors
	Severity of illness
	* ICU length of stay
	* Hyperglycaemia

:::column-margin
Notably, **muscle relaxants** are **not associated** with ↑ CIM/CIN.

## Pathophysiology


Myopathy:

* Loss of muscle mass
	* Rapid ↓ in muscle mass within 3 days of ICU admission:
		* 10% ↓ in thickness and cross-sectional area within first 3 days
		* Further 10% ↓ over following 4 days\
		Usually 2-3%/day.
	* ↑↑ Speed of wasting with ↑ number of organ failures
* ↓ Anabolism
	* Altered protein metabolism
	* Generalised inflammation
* Myonecrosis
* ↓ Skeletal muscle ATP synthesis

Neuropathy:

* Acquired channelopathy of voltage-gated sodium channels\
Widely present but poor correlation with dysfunction.
* Axonal degeneration
	* Associated with ↑ BSL

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

Bedside:

Laboratory:

Imaging:

Other:

* Electrophysiology
	* Rarely performed in practice
	* Required for diagnosis of peripheral nerve injury

## Management


**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
* Procedural
* Physical

**Supportive care**:

* E
	* Physiotherapy
		* ↓ Catabolic effects of immobilisation and bed rest
		* ↑ Anabolism
* G
	* Feeding\
	↑ Anabolism.
	* Insulin\
	↑ Anabolism.


**Disposition**:

**Preventative**:

* Minimise sedation and ventilation time
	* Early wakening
	* Spontaneous breathing
	* Early mobilisation


### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

* Electrical stimulation\
No ↑ muscle mass, possibly due to:
	* Impaired anabolic response
	* Electrical damage to muscle
* Extra nutrition\
No ↑ muscle mass or outcome improvement.
* Tight glucose control\
Does ↓ muscle mass loss, but results in ↑↑ hypoglycaemia and ↑ mortality.

## Anaesthetic Considerations

## Complications

* Death
* D
	* Persistent weakness
* E
	* ↑ Osteoporosis and fracture risk

## Prognosis


Significant morbidity and mortality:

* Mortality\
↑ Short-term and 5-year mortality.
* Morbidity\
Severe functional limitations occur among survivors:
	* At 6-12 months
		* 70% have substantial limitations
		* 30% are carer-dependent
