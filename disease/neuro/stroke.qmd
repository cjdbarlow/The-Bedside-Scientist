# Stroke

Sudden onset of a constellation of neurological deficits secondary to a vascular event. Stroke symptoms are:

* **Focal** (usually)
* **Negative**\
i.e. Loss of usual function, rather than the presence of a new dysfunction.
* **Maximal** at **onset**
* Without precipitating event


Stroke is subdivided by cause into:

:::column-margin
Stroke is distinguished from TIA by resolution and radiological findings. A TIA is a clinical syndrome with:

* Abrupt onset of focal neurological symptoms consistent with ischaemia
* No radiological abnormality
* Resolution over 24 hours
:::

* **Ischaemic** (85%)\
Related to:
	* Thrombosis
	* Embolism
	* Hypoperfusion
* **Haemorrhagic** (15%)\
	* Intracerebral
	* Subarachnoid

Haemorrhagic stroke is covered under @sec-ich.

## Epidemiology and Risk

Epidemiology:

:::column-margin
![](/resources/stroke-death.png)

Stroke death in Australia in >55's, stratified by sex.
:::

* Second most common global cause of death\
Greatly reduced, due to control of hypertension in the community.
* Third most common cause of disability

Risk factors:

* Age\
Risk doubles every decade after 55.
* Smoking
* Cardiovascular disease
	* AF
	* HTN
	* Dyslipidaemia
	* DM
	* Previous stroke or TIA
	* IE
* Hypercoagulable state
	* Pregnancy
	* Factor V Leiden
	* Protein C/S deficiency
	* Antithrombin III deficiency
* Hyperviscosity
	* Myeloma
	* HHS


## Pathophysiology

All strokes result in interruption of cerebral blood flow, leading to cellular failure:

* Disruption to receptor and channel function
* Free radial release
* Mitochondrial dysfunction
* Membrane disruption
* Cell death


An ischaemic stroke has a:

* **Core infarct**\
Irretrievably damaged centre of brain, seen as cytotoxic oedema on CT. A large (>50mL) core suggests less recoverable tissue by endovascular therapy.
* **Ischaemic penumbra**\
*Potentially viable* region of brain around the ischaemic core, that is malperfused and dysfunctional but may be recoverable with restoration of blood flow.
	* A large pnenumbra may show better response to endovascular therapy
	* Slow progression of ischaemic penumbra (to core infarction) may indicate better *late* response to endovascular therapy


### Aetiology

Ischaemic:

:::column-margin
Large vessel thrombus/embolism is more amenable to endovascular retrieval than small vessel occlusion.
:::

* Embolic
	* Paradoxical embolism\
	PFO, ASD, VSD.
	* Cardiac embolism
		* AF
		* Valves
			* Degenerative
			* Prosthetic
			* Endocarditic
		* LV thrombus
			* Ischaemic
				* Aneurysm
				* Apical thrombus
			* Cardiomyopathy\
			Stasis.
	* Carotid embolism
	* Air
		* Surgery
		* Diving
* Large vessel
	* Atherosclerosis
	* AVM
	* Dissection
	* Vasospasm
	* Large vessel arteritis
		* GCA
		* Takayasu arteritis
* Small vessel
	* Vasculitis
	* Vasospasm\
	Cocaine, other sympathomimetics.
* Hypoperfusion\
Prolonged hypotension.

Haemorrhagic:

* Systemic HTN
* Vascular abnormality
	* Amyloid angiopathy
	* AVM
	* Intracranial aneurysm
	* Vasculitis
* Tumour\
With haemorrhage into it.
* Ischaemic stroke\
With haemorrhagic transformation.


## Clinical Manifestations

:::caution
Stroke severity is semi-objectively described using the [NIHSS](https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/715/nih-stroke-scale-score-nihs). However, **endovascularly correctable** stroke may have a **low NIHSS** score. NIHSS is **not** a guide for identifying patients for reperfusion therapies.
:::

Stroke symptoms include:

* **Negative**
* Usually **focal**
	* Motor
		* Limb weakness
		* Dysphagia
		* Ataxia
	* Sensation
	* Speech and language
		* Comprehension
		* Expression
		* Calculation
	* Non-focal include:
		* Syncope
		* Altered conscious state\
		Including loss of consciousness or locked-in syndrome.
		* Emotional lability
		* Incontinence
		* Cerebellar signs\
		Vertigo, tinnitus, dysphagia, dysarthria, diplopia, ataxia.
* **Maximal** at **onset**

: Abbreviated Overview of Stroke Syndromes


## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

Diagnosis relies on identifying both:

* A stroke syndrome
* The corresponding radiological deficit


Differential diagnoses include:

* Migraine\
Positive migraine symptoms (visual symptoms, paraesthesias) are less consistent with ischaemic stroke.
* Post-ictal deficit\
Should improve over minutes-hours.
* Mass lesion (e.g. Tumour, abscess)\
More gradual onset.
* PRES
* Intoxication

## Investigations

**Bedside**:

* BSL
* ECG\
Screen for AF.

**Laboratory**:

* Blood
	* FBE\
	Anaemia, polycythaemia.
	* Blood cultures\
	If considering endocarditis.
	* Lipids
	* ESR/CRP\
	↑ Suggests vasculitis.
	* Thrombophilia screen
	* Pregnancy


**Imaging**:

:::column-margin
CT non-con should be repeated 24 hours after perfusion therapy to evaluate for complications.
:::

* CT **non-contrast**\
	* **Grey-white differentiation** (<1 hour)\
	Occurs early  and suggests **irreversibly infarcted** brain tissue.
	* **Vasogenic oedema** (3-6 hours)\
	Hypodensity developing due to irreversible infarction.
	* **ICH**\
	Rapidly changes management plan.
	* **Hyperdense vessel**\
	Thrombus may be visible in an intracranial vessel (particularly MCA), indicating large vessel occlusion.
* **CT angiography**
	* **Occlusion**\
	Identification of large vessel occlusion to guide endovascular therapy.
	* Dissection
	* Athersclerosis
* **CT perfusion**
	* Penumbra identification\
	Identifies volume of ischaemic penumbra for supratentorial stroke.
* MRI
	* Identification of stroke\
	Particularly for the posterior fossa, which is more poorly imaged on CT.
	* Identification of ICH
	* DWI and FLAIR mismatch\
	Identifies penumbra.
* Echocardiography\
PFO, endocarditis.

:::column-margin
Echocardiography is more useful in younger patients, who are less likely to have "classical" embolic causes.
:::

## Management

**Resuscitation**:

:::caution
Thrombolysis (if indicated) should be given as soon as possible after ICH is excluded and hypertension is controlled.
:::

* Activate a **Stroke Code**\
Rapid activation of neurology, radiology, and interventional radiology dramatically streamlines care for these patients.
Establish:
	* Weight\
	To allow TPA to be dispensed.
	* Time **Last Seen Well**\
	To establish onset, and eligibility for reperfusion.
	* Anticoagulation status
* A
	* Airway protection\
		* Indications vary, but in RCTs have included:
			* GCS <8
			* Other aspiration risk
			* Respiratory failure (PCO~2~ > 48mmHg, PO~2~ < 60mmHg)
		* Removes the mortality and morbidity benefits of stroke unit admission
		* Is a very bad prognostic sign
* B
	* Normoxaemia\
	Investigate for a secondary cause (e.g., aspiration).
	* Normocapnoea\
	Hyperventilation may be required for high ICP.
* C
	* Blood pressure monitoring and control\
	Invasive if haemodynamically unstable or mechanically ventilated.
* D
	* EVD\
	May be required if obstructive hydrocephalus develops.
	* ICP control
		* Hyperventilation
		* Osmotic therapy
* E
	* Maintain normothermia\
	Treat temperature >38°C.


**Supportive Care**:

* A
	* Tracheostomy


**Disposition**:

* Mortality and morbidity are improved with specialist stroke unit admission\
Avoid ICU admission if possible.

### Ischaemic Stroke

**Resuscitation**:

* C
	* **Hypertension**\
	Aims (SBP/DBP):
		* Before thrombolysis: <185/<110
		* After thrombolysis: <180/105
		* No thrombolysis: <220/<120 or end-organ damage\
		↓ Cautiously (aim <15% reduction/24 hours) if not urgently required - ↑ morbidity with rapid ↓.
		* Agents
			* Labetalol 10-20mg IV
	* Hypotension\
	Much less common.
		* Aim SBP >90mmHg
		* Treat cause, and otherwise use noradrenaline

**Specific therapy**:

* **Reperfusion**\
	* Intravenous thrombolysis
 	* Intraarterial thrombolysis\
 	↑ Recanalisation rates but ↑↑ ICH.
 	* Thrombectomy
 * Pharmacological
	* **Aspirin**\
	Load (300mg) within **48** hours, but delay:
		* **24** hours following **thrombolysis**
		* Indefinitely if craniectomy planned
		* Clopidogrel should be used if aspirin is contraindicated
	* Anticoagulation\
	If required for another indication (e.g. AF), commence >4-14/7 after the stroke, depending on risk of haemorrhagic transformation. Delay is unlikely to be harmful given the repeat stroke risk (from AF) is probably low over this period.
	* Statin\
	High dose (e.g. atorvastatin 80mg).
* Procedural
	* Craniectomy\
	Two scenarios where this may be considered:
		* MMCAS with mass effect\
		↑ Survival with survivors having moderate-severe disability.
		* Cerebellar infarction with posterior fossa syndrome\
		Much better outcomes than for MMCAS.
	* EVD\
	Indicated for secondary hydrocephalus.

Relative contraindications for thrombolysis:

* Rapidly improving symptoms
* Seizure at time of stroke with residual postictal signs
* Major surgery in 14 days
* GI/GU bleeding in 21 days
* MI in 3 months
* Pregnancy

### Malignant Middle Cerebral Artery Infarction Syndrome

A massive swelling of the MCA territory driving by a proximal occlusion, leading to mass effect on the contralateral side. MMCAS:

:::column-margin
![](/resources/mmca-crani.png)

Outcomes at 12 months for patients randomised to decompressive craniectomy or non-surgical treatment for MMCAS ([Vahedi et al, 2007](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(07)70036-4/fulltext)).
:::

* Defined by >50% of MCA stroke affecteed on CT
* Occurs in 1-10% of patients with MCA CVA
* Has a mortality of 80%
* **Decompressive craniectomy**\
Significantly improves survival, but the majority of new survivors are at least moderately-severely disabled.

### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

* B
	* Hyperventilation
* D
	* ICP monitoring
	* Seizure prophylaxis
* H
	* Heparin infusion


## Anaesthetic Considerations

:::info
GA and sedation have been compared with no clear evidence of superiority
:::

:::column-margin
My approach is tailored to the individual patient, with a strong preference towards whatever will allow the proceduralist to **expedite reperfusion**.
:::

* A
	* Extubation\
	Should be extubated as soon as feasible.
* C
	* Arrhythmia\
	Correct electrolytes.
	* Blood pressure control
		* Prior to revascularisation: SBP <185 and MAP >10-20% of baseline
		* After revascularisat ion: SBP <160
* D
	* CVA
	* ICP management
* H
	* Bleeding\
	If thrombolysed prior.
* Other
	* Off the floor


## Complications

* Death\
30% 1-month mortality.
* A
	* Aspiration\
	Dysphagia common both with brainstem and hemispheric stroke.
* B
	* Pneumonia\
	Including VAP, if intubated.
	* PE\
	Accounts for **10%** of deaths following stroke.
* C
	* Dysrhythmia (40%)\
	Common.
* D
	* Malignant Infarction of the Middle Cerebral Artery (**MMCAS**)\
	* **Haemorrhagic transformation** (5%)\
	Bleeding into a previously ischaemic stroke.
		* Risks
			* Large infarct
			* Coagulopathy
			* Vascular risk factors
			* Hypertension
		* Management
			* Stop any residual thrombolysis
			* Repeat imaging
			* Correct coagulopathy
				* Cryoprecipitate 10U
				* TXA 1g
			* Neurosurgical evacuation may be indicated if mass effect
	* **Cerebral oedema** and ↑ ICP
	* **Hydrocephalus**
		* **Obstructive**\
		May be both more common and more severe following cerebellar than cortical infarction.
		* Ex-vacuo\
		Loss of brain tissue resulting in ↑ CSF volume.
	* **Seizure** (<10%)\
	Uncommon. Risk ↑ with stroke severity, and may indicated haemorrhagic transformation.
	* Hyperglycaemia (40%)
		* Common
		* Associated with mortality and morbidity

Things to consider if the stroke patient deteriorates:

* Haemorrhagic transformation
* Reinfarction/reocclusion
* ↑ ICP
* Seizure
* Hypoglycaemia
:::

## Prognosis

Outcome is highly dependent on the particulars of the individual neurology. With this in mind, poor prognostic factors include:

:::column-margin
Degree of disability following stroke is commonly quantified using the **Modified Rankin Scale** (mRS):

* 0: Asymptomatic.
* 1: No significant disability. Some symptoms, but IADLs.
* 2: Slight disability. Unable to to carry out all previous activities, but IADLs.
* 3: Moderate disability. Requires some help, able to walk unassisted.
* 4: Moderately severe disability. Assistance with PADLs and walking.
* 5: Severe disability. Constant nursing care, bedridden, incontinent.
* 6: Dead
:::

* Age\
>85 has 35% in-hospital mortality.
* Requiring mechanical ventilation\
~50% in-hospital mortality (lowest for ischaemic stroke) and significantly ↑ disability in survivors.


## Key Studies

Endovascular therapy:

* [MR CLEAN](www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1411587) (2015)
	* 500 patients >18 with occlusion of ACA or MCA
		* <6 hours from onset
		* NIHSS >2
	* Intra-arterial therapy vs usual care\
	Majority (83%) mechanical thrombectomy, very few (0.4%) received intra-arterial thrombolysis, 16% received no intervention
	* Significant improvement in 90 day mRS, NIHSS at discharge, and final infarct volume
	* Multiple centres in the Netherlands
	* Slightly unbalanced group sizes
	* Higher ischaemic stroke rate at 90 days in treatment group\
	Confounded by concurrent carotid stenting in some of this group.
* [DAWN](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1706442) (2018)
	* 206 patients >18 with occlusion of ICA or M1
		* **Mismatch** between clinical deficit (by NIHSS) and radiological infarct volume\
		Designed to identify patients with viable penumbra.
		* Thrombolysis failed or contraindicated
		* NIHSS >10
		* Known to be normal 6-24 hours prior
	* Mechanical thrombectomy versus standard medical therapy
	* Significant improvement in mechanical thrombectomy group\
	49% functionally independent in thrombectomy group, compared to 13% in medical therapy group. Secondary outcomes also all improved.
	* Closed early
	* Industry sponsored
	* Required particular imaging
* [DEFUSE-3](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1713973) (2018)
	* 182 patients 18-90 with occlusion of ICA or M1
		* NIHSS >6
		* <70mL infarct volume with >15mL penumbra
	* Thrombectomy plus medical therapy versus medical therapy alone
	* Significant improvement in functional independence (45% vs 17%) at 90 days with endovascular approach
	* Required particular imaging and software access, may not be generalisable
* [DIRECT-MT](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001123) (2020)
	* 636 patients >18 with occlusion of ICA or M1/M2
		* <4.5 hours from onset
		* NIHSS >2
		* Eligible for thrombolysis
	* Thrombectomy alone versus thrombolysis and thrombectomy
	* No difference between groups in mortality or mRS
* [Yoshimura et al.](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2118191)
	* 203 Japanese adults with:
		* NIHSS >6
		* ASPECTS score 3-6\
		Indicating large ischaemic region.
	* Endovascular therapy vs medical care\
	98% of endovascular group received thrombectomy.
	* rt-rPA 0.6mg/kg was permitted
	* Significant improvement in mRS 0-3 at 90 days; RR 2.43
	* ↑ ICH rate within 48 hours in endovascular therapy group


Decompressive craniectomy:

* [DESTINY](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.485649#d3e366) (2007)
	* 32 patients 18-60 with large (>2/3^rds^ of territory) unilateral MCA stroke
		* 12-36 hours from diagnosis
		* NIHSS >18 (dominant) or >20 (non-dominant)
	* Decompressive craniectomy versus non-surgical
	* Improved survival in surgical group, worse disability
	* Stopped early for statistical significance in mortality end-point
* DECIMAL (2007)
* HAMLET (2009) 
* [DESTINY II](https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1311367) (2007)
	* 112 patients >60 with large unilateral MCA stroke
		* <48/24 of diagnosis
		* NIHSS >14 (non-dominant) or >19 (dominant hemisphere)
		* Red
	* Decompressive hemicraniectomy versus non-surgical
	* Double survival (57% vs 24%) in surgical group, but vast majority of survivors have moderate-severe (or worse) disability


Other:

* [SETPOINT2](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2792016)
	* ~380 German and American adults with ischaemic stroke, haemorrhage, or SAH predicted to need:
		* \>2 weeks of ventilation
		* Tracheostomy
	* Percutaneous tracheostomy at day 5 versus day 10
	* No difference in survival without significant disability at 6 months
	* Very morbid cohort\
	Poor neurological outcomes in general with high craniectomy rate.
