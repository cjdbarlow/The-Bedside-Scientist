# Delayed Cerebral Ischaemia

:::info
DCI was historically referred to as **vasospasm** due to the narrowed cerebral vasculature seen on angiogram. The nomenclature has changed due to recognition that:

* The pathophysiology is more complex than just 
* Not all patients with radiological vasospasm are symptomatic
* Not all symptomatic patients have radiological vasospasm
:::

Neurological deterioration in the setting of SAH that:

* Consists of one or more of:
	* **New focal** neurological **deficit**
	* **Drop** in **GCS** by **⩾2**
	* Cerebral infarction
* Lasts **more than one hour**
* **Cannot be explained** by any other condition

 

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Risk factors:

* SAH
	* Directly related to volume of interventricular blood.
	* Develops in **one-third** of SAH patients between **4 and 14 days**
* Hyponatraemia

## Pathophysiology

Mechanisms include:

* Vasospasm\
Of large and medium-sized intracranial arteries.
* Microcirculatory dysfunction
* Microthrombosis
* Cortical spreading depolarisation
* Neuro-inflammation

### Aetiology

## Clinical Manifestations

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

## Management

:::caution
Aggressive management of vasospasm is critical to prevent neurological injury and should progress in a stepwise fashion:

* Euvolaemia
* Induced hypertension
* Formal angiography with:
	* Cerebral angioplasty
	* Direct cerebral vasodilators
::: 

**Resuscitation**:

* C
	* Volume resuscitation
	To euvolaemia.
	* Induced hypertension
	* **Nimodipine**
		* 60mg Q4H PO\
		Can adjust to 30mg Q2H PO if symptomatic hypotension.
		* Administered to all SAH patients for 21 days
		* Improves outcome but does not appear to reduce radiological vasospasm\
		Neuroprotection probably by another mechanism.
	* Patients with suspected vasospasm should have induced hypertension\
	Usually results in SBP 180-200mmHg. Depending on preference for MAP or SBP targets, consider aiming:
		* MAP 20mmHg above baseline
		* SBP 20-40mmHg above baseline
	* Consider intraarterial vasodilators or angioplasty for vasospasm-related delayed cerebral ischaemia
