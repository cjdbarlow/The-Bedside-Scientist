# Complex Regional Pain Syndrome


Chronic neuroimmunological pain condition defined by:

* Continuing pain that is **disproportionate** to any inciting event
* Pain that is **regional**  
Not specific to a dermatome or peripheral nerve territory.
* With at least one finding from the following:
	* Sensory  
	Hyperaesthesia, allodynia.
	* Motor/tropic  
	↓ range of motion or motor dysfunction.
	* Sudomotor  
	Oedema, sweating changes, asymmetry.
	* Vasomotor  
	Asymmetry in temperature or skin colour, or skin colour changes.
	* Trophic findings
* No other diagnosis that explains the symptoms


CRPS is divided into two subtypes:

* Type I  
No evidence of nerve injury. Previously known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy.
* Type II  
Evidence of nerve injury present. Previously known as causalgia.

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Occurs in 0.5-2% of limb trauma.


Key risk factors:

* Female > Male
* Post-fracture

## Pathophysiology

Poorly understood, but multifactorial process involving central and peripheral nervous systems:

* Local tissue damage
* Inflammation
* Pain processing
* Endocrine and autonomic
* Immune

### Aetiology

## Clinical Manifestations

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

## Management

> * Non-pharmacological treatment is first line
> * Limited evidence for any particular therapy. Goals are to:
> 	* Restore function
> 	* ↓ pain and disability
> 	* Improve quality of life


Prevention:

* Avoid prolonged immobilisation
* Vitamin C 500mg daily
* Minimise tourniquet time


Non-pharmacological:

* Graded Motor Imagery
* Mirror therapy
* Physiotherapy
* Occupational therapy


Pharmacological:

* Oral corticosteroids
* Bisphosphonates
* Gabapentinoids
* Antidepressants


Refractory:

* Sympathetic nerve blocks
* Spinal cord stimulators
* Dorsal root ganglia stimulation	

### Medical

### Surgical

### Anaesthetic Considerations

### Ineffective Therapies

Include:

* Opioids  
Worsening of pain due to central sensitisation.
* Calcitonin  
No effect.
