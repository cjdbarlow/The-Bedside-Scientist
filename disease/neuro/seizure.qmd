# Seizure


*Covers emergency management of seizures, including status epilepticus. General management of [epilepsy](/disease/cns/epilepsy.md) is covered elsewhere.*

Seizures:

* A clinical manifestation of an abnormal and excessive discharge of neurones, leading to alteration of:
	* Consciousness
	* Motor function
	* Sensation
	* Autonomic function
* May be:
	* Partial  
	Arise from one hemisphere.
		* Simple
		* Complex
		* Partial onset, with generalisation
	* Generalised  
	Activity across both hemispheres.
		* Inhibitory
			* Absence
			* Atonic
		* Excitatory
			* Myoclonic
			* Clonic
			* Tonic
	* Pseudoseizures
	* Non-epileptic seizures


Status Epilepticus is:

* A medical emergency
* Defined as *either*:
	* Continuous seizure activity for 30 minutes
	* Intermittent seizure activity over 30 minutes, during which consciousness is not regained
* Diagnosed clinically  
Characterised by:
	* Generalised tonic-clonic seizures
	* Loss of consciousness
	* Urinary incontinence
	* Tongue-biting

## Emergency Management

>* Manage ABCs: Ensure airway protection, supplmental oxygen, and cardiovascular stability
>* Consider early 50% Dextrose IV if ↓ BSL is a possibility

Principles of management:

* Most convulsive seizures cease within 2-3 minutes
* Any seizure continuing ⩾5 minutes is unlikely to resolve spontaneously
* All seizures lasting ⩾2 minutes longer than the patients usual seizure should be trated
* ↑ Seizure duration associated with ↓ response to treatment

Treatment:

* Maintain airway
* Provide supplmental oxygen
* Establish IV access
* 50ml 50% Dextrose IV  
If hypoglycaemic.
* [Administer antiepileptic](#rx)

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

Physiological changes occur in two stages:

* First stage
	* ↑ Cerebral metabolism
	* ↑ CBF
	* ↑ BSL and lactate
	* ↑↑ Catecholamine release
		* ↑ CO/HR/BP/CVP  
		Compensation reduces cerebral damage in first 30-60 minutes.
* Second stage  
Compensatory mechanisms exhausted.
	* Cerebral damage may occur
	* Failure of cerebral autoregulation
		* Hypoxia
		* ↓ BSL
		* Cerebral oedema  
		↑ ICP.

## Clinical Manifestations

### History

### Examination

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

Blood:

* ABG
	* Lactate
	* BSL
* FBE/Coagulation assay
* UEC/CMP
* LFTs
* Drug lvels

CXR:

* If concern for aspiration


## Management{#rx}

Gradual escalation of therapy:

* Premonitory  
	* 10mg SL or IN midazolam
	* 10-20mg PR diazepam
* Early status
	* Lorazepam 0.1mg/kg IV
	* Diazepam 0.1mg/kg IV
* Established status
	* Phenytoin 15-18mg/kg IV load, given at 50mg/min
	* Phenobarbital 10-15mg/kg IV, given at 100mg/min
* Refractory status
	* Thiopental 100-250mg IV
	* Midazolam 0.1-0.3mg/kg IV, then infuse at 0.05-0.4mg/kg/hr  
	Can be used as an alternative to phenobarbital.
	* Propofol 2mg/kg IV, then infusion at 5-10mg/kg/hr
