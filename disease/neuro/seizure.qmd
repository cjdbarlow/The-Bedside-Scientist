# Seizures {#sec-Seizure}

Seizures are the **clinical manifestation** of an **abnormal** and **excessive** **discharge** of **neurones**, with alterations of consciousness, motor, sensory, or autonomic function. Seizures are classified into:

:::column-margin
Covers emergency management of seizures, including status epilepticus. Epilepsy is covered at @sec-Epilepsy, and NCSE is covered at @sec-ncse.
:::

* **Partial**\
Arise from one hemisphere.
	* Simple
	* Complex
	* Partial onset, becoming generalised
* **Generalised**\
Activity across both hemispheres.
	* Inhibitory
		* Absence
		* Atonic
	* Excitatory
		* Myoclonic
		* Clonic
		* Tonic
* **Pseudoseizures**
* **Non-epileptic** seizures


:::crisis
**Status Epilepticus** is:

* A medical **emergency**
* Defined as *either*:
	* **Continuous seizure** activity for **5 minutes** without return of consciousness
	* **Recurrent seizure** activity over **30 minutes**, between which **consciousness** is **not regained**\
\
* **Refractory status epilepticus** are seizures non-responsive to first and second line agents.
* **Super-refractory status epilepticus** are seizures continuing despite general anaesthesia
:::


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

Physiological changes occur in two stages:

* First stage
	* ↑ Cerebral metabolism
	* ↑ CBF
	* ↑ BSL and lactate
	* ↑↑ Catecholamine release
		* ↑ CO/HR/BP/CVP\
		Compensation reduces cerebral damage in first 30-60 minutes.
	* ↑ Temperature\
	Only partially obviated by muscle relaxation, as partially driven by ↑ sympathetic drive.
	* Normal termination mechanisms fail
		* Internalisation of GABA receptors\
		Accounts for ↓ response to benzodiazepines with ↑ seizure duration.
* Second stage\
Compensatory mechanisms exhausted.
	* Cerebral damage may occur
	* Failure of cerebral autoregulation
		* Hypoxia
		* ↓ BSL
		* Cerebral oedema\
		↑ ICP.
	* ↑ Catecholamines\
	Cessation may precipitate hypotension and hypoglycaemia following seizure resolution.


### Aetiology

* C
	* Hypertensive encephalopathy\
	**Eclampsia**.
* D
	* CVA
	* Tumour
	* Degenerative
		* Dementia
		* Alzheimer's Disease
	* Post-syncope
* F
	* Hypo/hypernatraemia
	* Hypo/hypercalcaemia
	* Hypo/hypermagnesaemia
	* Hypoglycaemia
	* Uraemia
* G
	* Hepatic encephalopathy
* Immune
	* Multiple sclerosis
* Traumatic  
Post-traumatic epilepsy associated with:
	* Early seizures
	* Depressed skull fractures
	* ICH
* Infective
	* Meningitis
	* Encephalitis
* Toxin/Drug
	* **Low antiepileptic drug levels**
	* Toxicity
		* Antibiotics
			* Cephalosporins
			* Isoniazid
		* Immunosuppression
			* Tacrolimus
		* TXA
		* Recreational
			* **Alcohol**\
			Toxicity and withdrawal.
			* Cocaine
			* Amphetamines



## Clinical Manifestations

:::info
* Most convulsive seizures cease within 2-3 minutes
* Any seizure continuing ⩾5 minutes is unlikely to resolve spontaneously
* All seizures lasting ⩾2 minutes longer than the patients usual seizure should be treated
* Rapid control ↓ brain injury
* ↑ Seizure duration associated with:
	* ↓˛Response to treatment
	* ↑ Risk of refractory status epilepticus
:::

Seizures affect:

* Consciousness
* Motor function
	* Abnormal muscle contraction
		* Tonic\
		Sustained.
		* Clonic\
		Interrupted.
	* May begin generalised or with focal onset, evolving into bilateral convulsive SE
* Autonomic function
	* Urinary incontinence

### History

Covers:

* Seizure
	* Time of onset
	* Time of offset
	* Prodromal symptoms
	* Manifestations\
	Sequence of involvement/evolution.
* Past or family history of epilepsy
* Medications taken\
	* Compliance
	* New medications
	* Recreational drug use
* Other precipitants
	* Drug withdrawal


### Examination

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

Include:

:::column-margin
Determination of pseudo-seizures can be difficult and is best confirmed with EEG.
:::

* Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (pseudoseizures)
	* Variable manifestations from event to event
	* Non-sustained convulsions
	* ↑ Movement with restraint
	* Suggestible movements
	* Resistance to eye opening
	* Absence of pupillary dilatation
	* Normal tendon reflexes post-convulsion
	* Paucity of metabolic consequences

## Investigations

Bedside:
* ABG
	* Lactate
	* BSL


Laboratory:

* Blood
	* FBE/Coagulation assay
	* UEC/CMP
	* LFTs
	* TFTs
	* Drug levels
* CSF
	* Meningitis


Imaging:

* CXR\
Aspiration.
* CTB\
Investigation of structural cause.


Other:

* Diagnostic
* Required following resolution without improvement in conscious state\
15% of this group have NCSE.
* Changing appearance over time
	* Initially discrete seizure activity
	* Continuous monomorphic discharges
	* Periodic epileptiform discharges



## Management

:::info
**Principles**:

* Seizure termination
* Treat underlying cause
* Prevent recurrence
:::

:::column-margin
The more the seizure is disturbing consciousness, the greater the risk of brain injury to the patient therefore there is strong justification to escalate treatment.
:::

**Resuscitation**:\

* A
	* Airway protection
* B
	* Supplemental oxygenation
* C
* D
	* **50% Dextrose** 50mL IV with **thiamine** 100mg IV
	Low threshold if ↓ BSL is a possibility.
	* **Seizure termination**
	See below.


**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
	* Seizure termination\
	Choice depends on timing, IV access, and drug availability.
		* **Premonitory**
			* 10mg SL or IN midazolam
			* 10-20mg PR diazepam
		* **Early status**
			* Lorazepam 0.1mg/kg IV
			* Diazepam 0.1mg/kg IV
		* **Established status**
			* Phenytoin 20mg/kg IV load, given at 50mg/min\
			Always should be combined with a benzodiazepine for seizure termination.
			* Phenobarbital 10-15mg/kg IV, given at 100mg/min
		* **Refractory status**
			* Highly sedating anaesthetic agents\
			Continue infusions for **12 hours** before attempting to wean therapy. Options include:
				* Thiopental 100-250mg IV
				* Midazolam 0.1-0.3mg/kg IV, then infuse at 0.05-0.4mg/kg/hr\
				Can be used as an alternative to phenobarbital.
				* Propofol 2mg/kg IV, then infusion at 5-10mg/kg/hr
			* Ketogenic diet
	* Maintenance antiepileptic
		* Phenytoin
			* **20mg/kg** IV load
			* Wait **2 hours** before checking levels following loading dose
			* May precipitate hypotension
			* Avoid if usually on phenytoin
			* Avoid if drug induced seizures
		* Valproate
			* **40mg/kg** IV load
			* Non-sedating
			* Levels can be checked immediately
		* Levetiracetam
			* **60mg/kg** IV load
* Procedural
* Physical

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:




### Anaesthetic Considerations

### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

## Complications

* Death
* D
	* Permanent neurological deficit\
	Neuronal cell death occurs after ~30 minutes of status.
	* Focal epilepsy


## Prognosis

Poor prognostic signs include:

* Age
* Aetiology
	* CNS infection
	* HIE\
	Usually fatal.
* Degree of impaired consciousness
* Refractory status


Good prognostic signs include:

* Aetiology
	* Drug withdrawal
	* Drug induced
	* Systemic infection
