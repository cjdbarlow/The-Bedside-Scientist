# Overview of Neuromuscular Disease

* Describes a heterogenous group of skeletal muscle defects
* Are classified by:
	* Cause:
		* Congenital
		* Acquired
	* Anatomical site
		* Pre-junctional
		* Junctional
		* Post-junctional

### Types of Neuromuscular Disease


|Cause|Congenital|Acquired|
|--|--|
|Pre-junctional|Peripheral Neuropathies:<br>- Charcot-Marie-Tooth<br>- Fredrichs ataxia|- Motor neurone disease<br>- MS<br>- GBS<br>- Diabetic neuropathy|
|Junctional||- MG<br>- Eaton-Lambert Syndome|
|Post-junctional|Dystrophicas:<br>- Duchenne<br>- Becker's<br><br>Myotonias:<br>- Myotonic Dystrophy<br>- Myotonia congenita<br>- Hyper-, hypokalaemic periodic paralysis<br><br>Metabolic disorders<br><br>Mitochondrial disorders|- Inflammatory myopathies<br>- Critical illness myopathy|

### Anaesthetic Considerations

* A
	* Aspiration risk  
	Due to gastric dysmotility.
	* Strict extubation criteria  
	May require perioperative ICU admission.
* B
	* Respiratory function  
	High incidence of peri-operative respiratory complications due to:
		* Respiratory and pharyngeal muscle impediment
		* Progressive spinal deformities
		* Potential difficult airway
		* Strongly consider perioperative BiPAP
		* Continuous SpO~2~ monitoring until consciousness resumed
	* CXR
	* PFTs
* C
	* Cardiac function
		* Cardiac reserve may be difficult to quantify as exercise tolerance limited by the disorder
	* ECG
	* TTE
* D
	* Avoidance of **volatile**
		* Primarily due to ↑ risk of rhabdomyolysis, rather than ↑ MH risk (though this may still be present)
		* TIVA with a clean anaesthetic machine is recommended
	* Regional anaesthesia
		* Advantageous if significant cardiac or respiratory disease; and so is recommended whenever appropriate
		* Autonomic dysfunction may be exacerbated with regional techniques
		* Consider avoiding if rapidly progressing neurological deficit
	* Minimise opioid use  
	Multimodal analgesia, including regional techniques preferred.
* E
	* Avoidance of **neuromuscular blockers**
		* Depolarising agents contraindicated (except in myasthenia gravis) due to:
			* Massive potassium efflux  
			Upregulation of extra-junctional receptors, and presence of foetal γ isoforms of the ACh receptor.
			* Fasiculations may cause trismus and prevent intubation and ventilation.
			* Rhabdomyolysis
		* Non-depolarising agents:
			* Usually show excessive sensitivity  
			Use at **10-20% of recommended dose**.
			* Monitor block
			* Use agents with a rapid degradation  
			e.g. Atracurium.
			* Avoid reversal  
			Acetylcholinesterases may lead to hyperkalaemia.
	* Thermoregulation  
	Usually impaired. Vulnerability to both hypo- and hyperthermia.
		* Ensure normothermia pre-induction and actively warm
		* Hypothermia may:
			* Exacerbate myotonia
			* ↑ sensitivity to non-depolarising agents
			* Aggravate rhabdomyolysis

### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

## Complications

Include:

* Death  
Usually due to respiratory failure.
* Respiratory failure
	* Exhaustion
	* Atelectasis
	* Aspiration  
	Bulbar weakness.
	* OSA
	* Spinal deformities  
	Restrictive lung disease.
* Cardiac
	* Cardiomyopathies
	* Arrhythmia
* Myotonic contractures


### Myotonic Contractures  

Muscle spasm due to excessive Na^+^ influx or Cl^-^ efflux across a membrane. Contractures are usually:

* Due to drugs or environmental conditions
	* Suxamethonium
	* Anti-cholinesterases
	* Opioids
	* Temperature
	* Acidosis
	* Shivering
* Not responsive to:
	* Neuromuscular blockade
	* Regional/neuraxial anaesthesia
* Treated with:
	* Correction of cause
	* Sodium channel blocking agents
		* Lignocaine
		* Antiarrhythmics
