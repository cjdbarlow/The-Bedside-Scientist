# Intracerebral Haemorrhage {#sec-ich}

Intracerebral haemorrhage is bleeding into brain parenchyma, usually from a vascular cause. 

:::column-margin
This discusses "pure" ICH, which most commonly occurs with haemorrhagic stroke.\
\
Pure ICH from aneurysmal bleeding is rare, as the majority have subarachnoid (SAH) or ventricular (IVH) extension. Trauma often causes a variety of intra- and extra-axial bleeds, although isolated contusions are common.

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

Haemorrhage:

* Size is a function of the anatomical resistance of the site of bleeding
	* Cortical typically larger than pontine
* Degree of dysfunction is determined by the region of brain destroyed
	* Pontine typically more disabling than cerebral

:::column-margin
Intra**cranial** haemorrhage can be divided into:

* Intra-axial\
Intracerebral haemorrhage.
* Extra-axial
	* EDH
	* SDH
	* SAH
	* IVH
:::

### Aetiology

Causes:

* Vascular
	* Hypertensive haemorrhage\
	Prolonged systemic hypertension results in vascular degeneration and formation of microaneurysms, usually at bifurcations.
	* Aneurysmal\
	Cerebral aneurysms can occasionally cause ICH without SAH.
	* AVM
* Trauma

## Clinical Manifestations

* Usually no prodrome
* Sudden onset and rapid deterioration with:
	* Focal neurology
	* Depression of consciousness
	* ↑ ICP\
	Ocular palsies.

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

Key differential diagnoses:

* Ischaemic stroke\
Difficult to distinguish clinically in early stages.

## Investigations

## Management

**Resuscitation**:\

:::column-margin
General principles of management are the same as for ischaemic stroke, with the obvious exceptions of anticoagulation and thrombolysis.
:::

* C
	* Hypertension control\
	SBP target <140mmHg.

***Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
	* Reversal of anticoagulation
* Procedural
	* EVD\
	Indicated in:
		* Secondary hydrocephalus
		* Intraventricular extension
* Physical

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:

### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

* Hyperventilation\
↓ PaCO~2~ to <30mmHg results in ↓ CBF and cerebral ischaemia
* Steroids
