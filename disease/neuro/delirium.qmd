# Delirium

Acute **confusional state** secondary to an **organic** brain disorder that is:

* **Fluctuant**
* Characterised by **impairments in**:
	* **Orientation**\
	To time, place, and person.
	* **Attention**\
	* **Grasp**\
	Lack of contextual understanding - does not appreciate they are a patient, you are a clinician, they are in a hospital.
* Divided into **three subtypes**:
	* **Hypoactive**\
	Sedated and inattentive, but docile and cooperative meaning that it is relatively underdiagnosed.
	* **Hyperactive**\
	Agitated, aggressive, and uncooperative.
	* **Mixed**\
	Fluctuant between hypoactive and hyperactive forms.

:::column-margin
Delirium tremens is a subtype of delirium occurring 48-72 hours after alcohol withdrawal, and is covered elsewhere.
:::


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Delirium is exceedingly common in inpatients:

* Occurring in:
	* ~70% of ventilated ICU patients
	* ~50% of surgical patients
	* ~30% of medical patients
* Majority are hypoactive delirium

:::column-margin
Despite this documented high prevalence, it is likely delirium is still under-diagnosed.

## Pathophysiology

Poorly understood; proposed mechanisms include:

* TNF-α activation in microglia
* Altered cerebral blood flow
* Thalamic dysfunction
* Relative dopamine excess

### Aetiology

## Clinical Manifestations


## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

Screening for delirium is recommended:

* By major intensive care societies
* Regularly
	* Usually daily in appropriate patients.
	* Unclear how this should best be performed in practice
	* Sensitivity and specificity of screening tools varies widely between publications\
	Likely affected substantially by implementation and local practice.
* Using standardised tools
	* Confusion Assessment Model (CAM-ICU)
	* Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC)


:::column-margin
Both scores are designed for binary prediction (present/absent) of delirium, although quantification of a spectrum of delirium is also possible.
:::


### Confusion Assessment Model

The CAM-ICU score is:

* A point in time assessment
* Specific but not sensitive for delirium
* Relatively quick and straightforward to perform
* Requires prior calculation of the RASS

## Management

:::priority
* Maximise preventative interventions\
Predominantly non-pharmacological.
* Correct cause
* Minimise pharmacological intervention
* Remember the family\
Emphasise delirium is common and transient.
:::


**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
	* Antipsychotics
		* Typical antipsychotics
			* Haloperidol
				* 0.5-10mg, usually 1-2mg IV
				* Risk of QTc prolongation
		* Atypical antipsychotics\
		Lower extrapyramidal side effects.
			* Olanzapine
				* 2.5-5mg PO BD
				* Can be given via sublingual wafers
			* Quetiapine
				* 12.5-50mg PO BD
			* Risperidone
				* 0.5-1mg PO BD
	* α~2~-agonists
		* Clonidine
		* Dexmedetomidine
* Physical\
**Non-pharmacological interventions** are covered under preventative management, but remain a critical part of treating active delirium.

:::column-margin
{{< include /includes/extrapyramidal.qmd >}}
:::

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:

**Preventative**:

* **Orientation aids**
	* **Orientation clues**
		* **Windows** with natural light
		* **Clocks**
		* **Calendars** with todays date
		* Verbal statements of the time, date, and location
	* **Familiar individuals**
		* **Family**
			* Greatest familiarity
			* Sense of control
			* Sense of safety
		* Nursing and medical staff
* **Minimise disorientation**
	* Sensory impairments
		* Hearing aids
		* Glasses
* **Minimise agitation**
	* Environmental noise
	* Sleep quality
	* Physical restraints
	* **Medical restraints**
		* **IDC**
		* IV lines	
* Address **risk factors**
	* Minimise sedation\
	Avoid deep sedation without good reason.
	* Pain
	* Bowel care
	* Polypharmacy
	* Appropriate oxygenation and haemodynamic target
	* Electrolyte correction
* Patient **diaries**
	* Fill gaps in memory after ICU discharge
	* Rationalise traumatic hallucinations

:::column-margin
Balancing opioid related harm and pain management is a difficult balancing act. On balance, I am to ensure adequate analgesia (minimising opioid when able, and using lower-risk opioids) and accept some opioid related harm.
:::

### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

* Benzodiazepines\
Significant independent risk factor for delirium, and recommended only for:
	* Delirium tremens
	* Urgent control of dangerous hyperactive delirium 
* Prophylactic antipsychotics\
May ↓ duration or severity, but no improvement in mortality.
* Anticholinesterases\
Worsen delirium.
* Melatonin\
No change in rate of delirium, or quality and quantity of sleep.
