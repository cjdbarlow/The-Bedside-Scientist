# Hepatic Encephalopathy {#sec-hep_enc}

Brain dysfunction predominantly due to hyperammonaemia which occurs secondary to liver failure or portosystemic shunting, and:

* Has a wide variety of clinical appearances
	* Inattention
	* Psychomotor retardation
	* Personality changes
	* Agitation
	* Somnolence
	* Coma
* Onset defined as either onset of:
	* Asterixis
	* Confusion
* Is commonly contributed to by septic encephalopathy


:::column-margin
Degree of hepatic encephalopathy is strongly associated with the degree of hyperammonaemia, and so is typically less severe in ACLF compared to ALF.

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

## Clinical Features

:::column-margin
The **Parson-Smith scale** grades hepatic encephalopathy into:

1. Mild confusion/irritability, ↓ attention
2. Disorientation, drowsiness, inappropriate
3. Somnolent but rousable, incoherent
4. Coma

## Assessment

### History

### Exam

### Investigations

**Bedside**:

**Laboratory**:

* Blood
	* Ammonia

:::column-margin
Ammonia >200μmol/L associated with cerebral herniation.
:::

**Imaging**:

**Other**:

### Diagnostic Approach and DDx


## Management

:::priority
* Manage ICP with **quad-H** therapy
	* **Hyperventilation**
	* **Haemodiafiltration**
	* **Hypernatraemia**
	* **Hypothermia**
* Supportively manage concurrent liver failure
:::

**Resuscitation**:

:::column-margin
Invasive intracranial pressure monitoring associated with ~10% intracranial haemorrhage rate.
:::

* A\
	* Secure if high grade (III/IV) encephalopathy
* B
	* **Hyperventilation**\
	For ICP control.
* C
	* Defend cerebral perfusion\
	MAP 65-70mmHg, or CPP >50mmHg if measuring ICP.
* D
	* **↑ ICP**\
		* General measures\
		If **grade 3/4** encephalopathy, recommend:
			* Intubation
			* Sedation
			* Avoid stimulation
			* Head-up positioning
		* Consider invasive ICP management if **all** of:\
			* Grade 3-4 encephalopathy
			* Hyperacute liver failure
			* Ammonia >150mmolL
			* Young
* E
	* **Hypothermia** (**35°C**)\
	In addition to ↓ in ICP, also ↓ proteolysis and ammonia production.
* F
	* **Hypernatraemia**\
	148-152mmol/L.


:::column-margin
The **combination** of **hyperventilation**, **haemodiafiltration**, **hypernatraemia**, and **hypothermia** is referred to as **quadruple-H** or quad-H therapy.
:::

**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
	* Hyperammonaemia
		* **Lactulose**\
		May ↓ hepatic encephalopathy but lead to gaseous intestinal distension.
		* **Rifaximin** 550mg PO BD\
		Combination with lactulose more effective than lactulose alone.
* Procedural
* Physical

:::column-margin
Lactulose, an osmotic diuretic, ↓ ammonia by unconventional means:

* Lactulose is metabolised by gut bacteria into lactic and acetic acid
* The ↓ in colonic pH favours conversion of ammonia (NH~3~) to ionised ammonium (NH~4~^+^), which is trapped in the colon\
This is **analogous to urinary alkalinisation** for elimination of weak acids.
* Trapped ammonium is then cleared by the more mundane osmotic laxative effect

Rifaximin is a non-absorbed, broad-spectrum antibiotic that ↓ gut flora concentrations, ↓ ammonia production.
:::

**Supportive care**:


**Disposition**:

**Preventative**:

* Rifaximin 550mg PO BD\
Significant (~60%) in hepatic encephalopathy in patients with chronic liver disease.
