# Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy


Most common muscular dystrophy of childhood.

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

DMD:

* X-linked recessive disorder
* Incidence of 1:3,500 live births

## Pathophysiology

Genetic absence of the gene coding for the dystrophin protein, which:

* Prevents dystrophin expression in muscle sarcolemma  
Subsequent weakness.
* Muscle fibres are poorly tethered due to sarcolemma weakness
* Muscle fibres are gradually replaced with fibrous connective tissue

### Aetiology

## Clinical Manifestations

Generally:

* Presents in early childhood
* Progressive proximal muscle wasting
* Waddling gait
* Pseudohypertrophy of calf muscles

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

## Management

### Anaesthetic Considerations

### Ineffective Therapies

## Complications

Include:

* Contractures
* Scoliosis
	* Restrictive lung disease
* Cardiomyopathies  
DCM in 50% of children by age 12.

## Prognosis

Usually fatal in late adolescence due to:

* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac failure
