# Maxillofacial Trauma

Combination of facial fractures and soft tissue damage that may be life-threatening due to:

* **Haemorrhage**
* **Airway compromise**
	* Bleeding
	* Oedema
		* Can be massive and cause significant distortion
		* Generally evolves over 24-48 hours
* Association with significant **intracranial injury**


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Associated with:

* Young\
Predominantly 15-25.
* Male
* Alcohol

## Pathophysiology

Mandibular fractures:

* Commonly occur at structurally vulnerable sites, independent of point of impact
	* Condyles\
	May **limit mouth opening**, even after muscle relaxation.
	* Symphysis\
	Point of midline fusion.
	* Angle
* Multiple fractures are common


Mid-face fractures:

:::column-margin
The midface acts similarly to a crumple zone on a car and collapses progressively under impact. **Multiple complex** facial **fractures** are therefore the most common presentation
:::

* Facial skeleton consists of several small compartments supported by three vertical buttresses
	* Compartments:
		* Orbits
		* Nasal cavities
		* Paranasal sinuses
	* Buttresses:
		* Nasomaxillary pillars
		* Zygomaticomaxillary pillars
		* Pterygomaxillary pillars
* Fracture-dislocations occur as the facial skeleton collapses around these pillars\
Occurs in a predictable fashion, giving rise to the **Le Fort** classification:
	* **Le Fort I**\
	Horizontal fracture of the maxilla at the plane of the nose.
		* Direct maxillary impact
	* **Le Fort II**\
	Freely mobile pyramid of maxilla.
		* Most common fracture
		* Inferior or lateral mandibular impact with a closed mouth
	* **Le fort III**\
	Separation of midface from the base of the skull.
		* Also known as craniofacial disjunction
		* May result in cribiform plate transection and CSF leak

Orbital fractures:

* Inferior orbital wall fracture most common\
Direct pressure on globe is transmitted back to the orbit, with the weakest wall shattering.
* May result in entrapment of globe or extra-ocular muscles
* Loss of visual acuity
* Abnormal eye movements

### Aetiology

Facial injures are almost all related to **blunt trauma**; common causes include:

* MVA
* Assault
* Falls
* Sport
* Industrial accidents

## Clinical Manifestations

Evaluation should include:

* Visible deformity
	* Asymmetry
	* Nasal septal deviation
* Fracture stability
	* Palpation of midface for mobile segments
	* Dental malocclusion
* Visual assessment
	* Visual acuity
	* Pupillary reflexes
	* Eye movements
* Cranial nerve function
	* Facial nerve
* Evidence of base of skull fracture
	* Enopthalmos\
	Retraction of the eye due to blowout fracture. Upward gaze is usually impaired.
	* Bleeding
		* Haemotympanum
		* Battle's sign
		* Raccoon eyes
* Orbital bruit\
Suggests carotid-cavernous sinus fistulae.

## Management

:::priority
Airway management can be complex due to interplay of:

* Trauma\
With effect of other injuries.
* Oedema
* Haemorrhage
	* Aspiration
	* Impaired topicalisation
	* Impaired 
:::

**Resuscitation**:

:::column-margin
This details management of isolated midface injuries and implies reasonably normal laryngeal and tracheal anatomy.\
\
Laryngotracheal trauma is rarer, and:

* Evidenced by stridor or hoarseness with overlying neck abnormalities
* Requires complex airway management strategies
* Covered under @sec-trauma_airway
:::

* A
	* Basic interventions
		* Head-up position\
		Patient may assume unusual positions that limit obstruction, this should be encouraged.
		* High flow oxygen
		* Regular suctioning
	* Advanced airway management\
	Planning should include senior airway clinicians. Considerations include:
		* Bag-mask ventilation often difficult
			* Limited mask seal
			* Pain
		* Fibre-optic nasal intubation for mandibular condyle fracture with limited mouth opening, without base of skull fractures
		* Non-condylar mandibular fractures are mobile when pain is controlled
		* Awake oral fibre-optic intubation for:
			* cervical spine injury, 
			* Mandibular condyle and base of skull fracture
		* Awake tracheostomy may be considered
* C
	* Bleeding
		* Direct pressure
		* Aggressive packing to wounds and nasal cavities

:::column-margin
Peculiar interventions that may assist airway patency include:

* **Tongue protraction**\
Suture through anterior tongue allows tongue to be pulled forwards.
* **Midface protraction**\
Anterior traction of the mobile midface may relieve obstruction but ↑↑ venous bleeding.
:::

**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
	* Prophylactic antibiotics\
	For CSF leak.
* Procedural
	* Angioembolisation\
	1^st^ line for intractable bleeding.
	* Surgical haemorrhage control
	* Debridement and washout\
	Within 24 hours.
	* Internal fixation\
	Often delayed 4-10 days until swelling has resolved.
* Physical

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:

**Preventative**:


### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

* Steroids\
No role in optic nerve injuyr.

## Anaesthetic Considerations

## Complications

Facial fractures have several associated injuries: 

* A
	* Dental injury
* C
	* Carotid-cavernous sinus fistula
* D
	* Cervical spine injury
	* Intracranial injury
	* Orbital injury\
	Vision loss or blindness in ~1%.
	* Base of skull fracture
		* CSF leak\
			* Occurs in 10-30%.
			* May present with either:
				* Rhinorrhoea
				* Otorrhoea
		* Meningitis uncommon despite the prevalance of CSF leak


:::column-margin
Bones that may result in dural tears and CSF leak include:

* Frontal bone
* Frontal sinus
* Nasoethmoid complex
* Fronto-orbital complex
