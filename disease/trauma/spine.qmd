# Spinal Cord Injury {#sec-acute_spine}

Spinal cord injuries are classified:

:::column-margin
This covers classification and management of acute spinal cord injuries, management of a patient with a chronic spinal cord injury are covered under @sec-chronic_spine.
:::

* Clinically by:
	* **Level**\
	Lowest segment with:
		* **Antigravity motor** function
		* **Normal sensory** function
	* **Degree**
		* **Complete**\
		No sensory or motor function in the S4-S5; i.e. no voluntary anal contraction or perianal sensation.
		* **Sensory Incomplete**
			* Sensory function preserved below level of the lesion
			* No motor function preserved more than 3 levels below the motor level
		* **Motor Incomplete**\
		Motor function preserved below the neurological level.
* Radiographically by **stability**

:::column-margin
Specific nomenclature includes:

* **Tetraplegia**\
Motor or sensory dysfunction of the upper and lower limbs due to injury to the cervical cord .
* **Paraplegia**\
Motor or sensory dysfunction of the lower limbs due to thoracic, lumbar, or sacral cord injury. Includes cauda equina and conus medullaris injury.
* **Zone of Partial Preservation**\
Spinal segments below the injury that have preserved motor or sensory function.
:::


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Associated with:

* Males
* Young
* Blunt trauma
	* VA
	* Falls
	* Sports-related injuries
* Spinal fractures\
20% of patients will have an associated cord injury.
* Head injury\
2-10%; more common with mores severe head injuries.


## Pathophysiology

The spinal cord:

* Extends from the foramen magnum to the L1-L2 level in adults
	* Ventral and dorsal roots exist at each intervertebral level
	* Cauda equina refers to the lumbo-sacral nerve segments that continue below the spinal cord\
	Less susceptible to injury due to the larger lumbar canal size.
* Provides sympathetic supply from T1-L2
* Provides parasympathetic supply from S2-S4\

:::column-margin
Parasympathetic supply to everything but the pelvic viscera is supplied by the vagus nerve.
:::

Spinal cord injury is biphasic, and is divided into:

* Primary injury\
Mechanical injury leading to focal injury to the cord via:
	* Compression\
	Haematoma.
	* Traction
	* Laceration
	* Ischaemia\
	Via spinal arterial injury.
* Secondary injury\
Local ischaemia extending from the site of injury, leading to haemorrhage into the cord and ultimately neuronal necrosis.


### Aetiology

## Clinical Features

:::caution
Beware the **rising lesion**: An ↑ in spinal cord injury level occurring with spinal cord oedema, which may precipitate respiratory failure.
:::

**Below the lesion** there is a:

* Loss of efferent pathways:
	* Weakness
	* Hypotonia
* Loss of afferent pathways:
	* Areflexia
	* ↓ Sensation
* Loss of autonomic (sympathetic) tone:
	* Vasodilatation
	* Bradycardia
	* Priapism
	* Urinary retention
	* Paralytic ileus

:::column-margin
**Paradoxical breathing** occurs when the diaphragm contracts in absence of chest wall tone, resulting in a paradoxical in-drawing of the chest during inspiration.
:::


### Spinal Syndromes

:::info
In addition to the general features described above, spinal cord injury can present with constellations of specific features.
:::

**Spinal Shock**:

* Altered physiological state that:
	* Occurs **immediately** following injury
	* May **persist** for between **48 hours to** several **weeks**
	* Resolves gradually
* Involves *lower* motor neuron dysfunction distal to the injury:
	* Flaccid paralysis
	* Hyporeflexia
	* Anaesthesia
	* Incontinence


**Neurogenic shock**:

:::column-margin
Shock is covered in detail under @sec-shock.
:::

* Distributive shock due to loss of sympathetic tone
* May occur within 30 minutes after injury and last up to 6 weeks
* Features include:
	* Hypotension\
	Significant orthostatic component.
	* Bradycardia
	* Hypothermia


**Central Cord Syndrome**:

* Motor and sensory dysfunction **greater** in the **arms than** the **legs**
* Due to injury of the centre cord\
Cervical segment affected due to location of cervical spinal tracts.
* Typically due to **hyperextension** with pre-existing spinal **canal stenosis**


**Anterior Cord Syndrome**:

:::column-margin
Anterior cord syndrome is most common after aortic pathology or surgery.
:::

{{< include /includes/anterior_cord.qmd >}}


**Brown-Séquard Syndrome**:

:::column-margin
Brown-Séquard Syndrome is *vanishingly* rare but remains a favourite of anatomists and examiners.
:::

* Ipsilateral loss of motor, proprioception, and fine touch below the level of the lesion
* Contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation ~1-2 levels below the lesion
* Due to penetrating injury to a transverse half of the spinal cord


**Conus medullaris Syndrome**:

* Genitourinary dysfunction:
	* Flacid paralysis of external anal sphincter
	* Faecal incontinence
	* Overflow urinary incontinence
	* Impotence
	* Perianal anaesthesia
* Due to T12-L1 injury


**Cauda equina Syndrome**:

* Constellation of:
	* Asymmetrical lower limb weakness\
	Predominantly LMN.
	* Sensory loss in the affected motor distribution
	* Bladder and bowel areflexia
* Due to injury to lumbosacral nerve roots below L1

:::column-margin
Injury at the thoracolumbar junction may affect both the conus medullaris and the cauda equina, resulting in features of both syndromes.
:::


### ASIA Impairment Scale

The American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale:

:::column-margin
{{< include /includes/motor_function.qmd >}}
:::

* Is the most validated injury for diagnosis and classification of spinal cord injury
* Can predict long-term motor outcome from initial exam
* Involves determining:
	1. **Sensory** level for the each side using **light touch** and **pin-prick sensation**
	2. Motor level for each side
	3. Determine the **neurological level**\
	This is the most cephalad of the levels determined in steps 1 and 2, i.e. the level where abnormality begins.
	4. Completeness\
	Presence or absence of sacral sparing, indicated by:
		* Anal contraction
		* Perianal sensation
	5. Grade
		* A: Complete injury
		* B: Sensory incomplete
		* C: Motor incomplete and **>50%** of **key muscle functions** below the neurological level are **⩾3/5**
		* D: Motor incomplete and **<50%** of **key muscle functions** below the neurological level are **⩾3/5**
		* E: Normal

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

Clinical assessment determines the need for:

* Immobilisation
* Imaging\
**Ruling-out** the need for imaging is performed with one of two assessments:
	* NEXUS
	* Canadian C-Spine rule

:::column-margin
Both NEXUS and the Canadian rules are highly sensitive, which is critical to avoid missing potentially significant lesions.
:::

### NEXUS

Imaging is **not needed** if **all of the following criteria are met**:

* No posterior midline cervical tenderness
* No intoxication
* No focal neurology
* No painful distracting injury
* Normal alertness\
Adequate **three object recall** at **5 minutes**.


## Investigations

:::info
* All patients not cleared on a clinical decision rule should have high-resolution multidetector row CT of the full spine, with an experienced practitioner reporting the images
* If concern despite normal CT → MRI\
e.g. Neurological deficit, high risk injury, CT abnormalities such as osteophytes that may cloud interpretation.
:::

**Imaging**:

:::column-margin
Plain radiographs no longer have any role in evaluating a suspected spinal cord injury. Historical approaches include:

* Plain imaging\
Sensitivity ~50%.
	* A-P
	* Lateral
	* Odontoid peg
* Dynamic studies\
Flexion-extension views.
:::

* **CT**
	* Highly sensitive\
	* May **miss** significant **unstable ligamentous injuries** that occur without bony involvement
* MRI\
Superior imaging of spinal cord and soft tissue, including unstable ligamentous injuries.


## Management

:::priority
* **Avoid secondary injury** by preventing cord ischaemia and further dislodgement
* Early fixation:
	* Improves neurorecovery by ↓ secondary injury in **incomplete injury**
	* Permit immediate rehabilitation and improves overall outcome, but not neurology, in **complete injury**
:::

**Resuscitation**:

:::column-margin
Principles for airway management are covered below under anaesthetic considerations.
:::

* A
	* C-spine immobilisation
* B
	* Supplemental oxygen
	* V~T~ 6-10mL/kg
* C
	* Maintain spinal cord perfusion\
		* **MAP 85-90mmHg**\
		For 72 hours.
		* Avoid SBP ⩽90mmHg\
		Native SBP may be 60-80mmHg in context of neurogenic shock.
		* **Blood pressure targets** should be maintained for **7 days**
	* Bradycardia\
	**May require atropine** or pacing; especially with **vagal response to intubation**.

:::column-margin
There is weak evidence that ↑ MAP may improve neurological outcome. This is usually easily achieved, and even one additional functional myotome can have substantial quality of life benefits.
:::

**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
* Procedural
	* Tracheostomy
		* C3 or above: Required
		* C4: Trial of extubation reasonable, but moderate chance of failure
		* C5 or below: Extubation onto NIV has reasonable chance of success 
	* Operative fixation\
	Fixation of **unstable** injuries **within 24 hours** permits:
		* Early mobilisation
		* Thromboprophylaxis
		* Desedation and assessment of:
			* Neurological level
			* Need for tracheostomy
* Physical
	* Chest physiotherapy


**Supportive care**:

:::column-margin
Percutaneous tracheostomy is as safe as surgical tracheostomy in a stable cervical injury.
:::

* A
	* **Tracheostomy**\
	Required in 20-50%; predictors include:
		* High level
			* Complete injuries above C5 almost always require tracheostomy
			* Complete injuries above C3 almost always require mechanical ventilation
		* Complete injury
		* Thoracic trauma
		* Emergency intubation
	* SLT assessment\
	Especially if anterior fixation.
* B
	* Chest physiotherapy
* D
	* Psychological support
* E
	* Pressure injury prevention
* F
	* IDC
	* Consider suprapubic catheter
* G
	* Stress ulcer prophylaxis\
	↑ Risk of gastric ulceration.
	* **Bowel care**\
	Stool softeners.
* H
	* Thromboprophylaxis\
	Enoxaparin should be commenced within 72 hours to ↓ VTE risk.


**Disposition**:

* Transfer to neurotrauma unit
* Early referral to rehabilitation


### Airway Management

**Intubation** considerations:

:::column-margin
~75% of spinal cord injury patients require intubation.
:::

* **MILS**\
Reduces amount of cervical spine movement during airway management. MILS:
	* Involves:
		* Stabilisation of the head by an assistant
		* Assistant holds the mastoid processes and occiput steady
	* May be performed:
		* Crouching, standing next to the operator holding to the mastoid processes
		* Facing the intubator, holding the occiput and stabilising the neck with the forearms on the chest
	* ↑ Rate of failed airway management
* Use airway **adjuncts**\
Use for mask ventilation to reduce:
	* Requirement for c-spine movement
	* Gastric insufflation
* **Avoid suxamethonium**
* Consider:
	* **Videolaryngoscopy**\
	At a minimum for all patients with high-thoracic or cervical spine injury.
		* Permits RSI
	* FOI\
	Reduces amount of cervical spine movement. May be performed awake or asleep.
		* May be difficult due to blood/secretions
		* Awake FOI
			* Coughing and gagging may lead to spine movement\
			May occur either from topicalisation, or if topicalisation inadequate.
			* Sedation limits post-intubation neurological assessment
		* Asleep FOI
	* Not using cricoid pressure\
	May worsen injury.


**Extubation** considerations:

:::column-margin
**Extubation failure** commonly **occurs** due to the combination of **secretion burden** and inadequate coughing, leading to sputum plugging.
:::

* No procedure or imaging requirements in the next 24 hours
* Able to tolerate NIV
* Cuff leak
* Respiratory function:
	* No hypoxia
	* No significant *reversible* pathology
	* Low secretion burden
	* VC >10mL/kg
* Neurological function
	* Participation in chest physiotherapy


### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

* Steroids
* Tirilazad
* Naloxone
* Nimodipine
* Induced hypothermia


## Anaesthetic Considerations

* A
	* Difficult airway due to immobilisation
* B
	* ***High*-tidal volume** ventilation\
	10mL/kg prevents atelectasis whilst avoiding high PEEP that displaces the diaphragm to a disadvantageous position. 
* C
	* Arterial line\
	Required if high thoracic injury or above.
	* Vasoactive support
		* Consider vasopressor infusion during induction
* E
	* **Suxamethonium** is **contraindicated 48-72 hours post-injury**\
	Fatal hyperkalaemia may result due to up-regulation of ACh receptors.
* G
	* Aspiration risk\
	High risk due to gastric dilation and ↓ emptying.


## Complications

Acute complications:

:::column-margin
Complications and management of chronic spinal cord injuries are covered under @sec-chronic_spine.
:::

:::column-margin
Respiratory complications are common and occur due to a combination of:

* Respiratory muscular paralysis
* Immobility
* ↑ Secretions\
Loss of sympathetic tone.
:::

* B
	* Respiratory failure
	* Atelectasis
	* Bronchospasm\
	If sympathectomy above T6.
	* Pneumonia\
	Mucous plugging.
	* PE
* C
	* Hypotension
		* Loss of sympathetic tone below lesion
		* Bradycardia (if >T1, causing loss of cardiac sympathetics)
	* Bradycardia
	* Autonomic dysreflexia
* E
	* Hypothermia\
		* Vasodilation and excessive heat loss below the injury
		* ↓ Ability to shiver
* F
	* Hyponatraemia\
	Common, likely due to RAS dysfunction due to reduced renal sympathetic tone.
	* Urinary retention
* H
	* VTE


:::column-margin
Autonomic dysreflexia is covered under @sec-and.
:::

## Prognosis

Reasonable prognostication possible with ASIA Scale:

* ASIA A
	* Poorest prognosis
	* 7% may reach ASIA B (sensory incomplete) at 1 year
	* None reach ASIA C (motor incomplete)
* ASIA B
	* 54% reach ASIA C or D at one year\
	* Much better functional outcomes
* ASIA C
	* Almost all ambulatory at discharge
* ASIA D
	* All ambulatory at discharge
