# Traumatic Brain Injury {#sec-trauma_tbi}

**Spectrum** of **brain injury** due to **cerebral oedema** and **impaired autoregulation**, classified by:

* **Severity**
	* Mild\
	GCS 13-15.
		* 70-80% of all TBI.		
		* Brief loss of consciousness
	* Moderate\
	GCS 9-12 after resuscitation
	* Severe\
	GCS ⩽8 after resuscitation
* **Timing**
	* **Primary brain injury**\
	Neuronal death from the initial trauma.
		* Major determinant of outcome
		* Relatively untreatable
	* **Secondary brain injury**\
	Additional harm that occurs due to post-injury insults.

:::column-margin
Primary brain injury is the damage done when the head hits the windscreen, secondary brain injury is everything that happens afterwards. Good prehospital, ED, and ICU care involves minimising secondary brain injury, since this the time when we can intervene.
:::

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

TBI is the:

* Leading cause of death in <45 year olds
	* ↑ In males

## Pathophysiology

**Primary brain injury**:

* Can involve various physical mechanisms:
	* Impact loading\
	Collision of head with object.
	* Impulsive loading\
	Sudden change in motion without physical contact
	* Static loading\
	Force where speed of occurrence is not significant.
	* Rotational shearing\
	Leads to axonal stretching and tearing\
		* Concentrated around the grey-white matter interface as:
			* Grey and white matter have slightly different densities
			* Rotational force results in small differences in the velocities of each tissue type
* Occurs due to brain deformation via:
	* Compression
	* Stretch
	* Shearing
* Results in a constellation of effects:
	* Inflammation\
	Leads to **cerebral oedema** via:
		* Altered blood-brain barrier permeability
		* Direct neuronal injury
		* Microvascular injury
	* Haemorrhage\
	Micro and macrovascular haemorrhage:
		* Extra-axial haemorrhage
			* EDH
			* SDH
		* Intra-axial haemorrhage
			* SAH
			* Contusions
	* Sympathetic surge


**Secondary brain injury** occurs due to:

:::column-margin
Physiological derangements from other traumatic injuries will compound to further worsen secondary brain injury.
:::

* Cerebral ischaemia
	* ↓ CPP
		* Hypotension
			* Hypovolaemia
			* Shock
		* ↑ ICP
			* Cerebral oedema
			* Mass effect		
	* Hypoxaemia
		* Pulmonary injury
		* Neurogenic pulmonary oedema
	* Direct vascular injury\
	Regional ischaemia.
* Impaired cerebral autoregulation
	* Hyper/hypocarbia
	* Hypo/hyperthermia
* Induction of apoptosis
	* Axonal degeneration
	* Synaptic loss


Medium to long-term effects occur over:

* Weeks-months
	* Neuroplastic remodelling
	* Apoptotic cell death
* Months-years
	* Further remodelling
	* Cognitive dysfunction
	* HPA dysfunction.


### Aetiology

Primary brain injury causes include:

* Falls\
Most common.
* MVA\
Most common cause of death.
* Violence
	* NAI
	* Domestic violence
	* Elder abuse
* Industrial accidents
* Sport

: Drivers of Secondary Brain Injury


## Clinical Manifestations

Features include:

* Nausea/vomiting
* Cognitive dysfunction
* Behavioural change
* Obtundation → coma


Examination:

* ↑ Pupil size and ↓ reactivity suggest ↑↑↑ ICP with impending herniation

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

**Bedside**:

**Laboratory**:

**Imaging**:

* CTB
	* Goals:
		* **Exclude** a neurosurgically **correctable mass lesion**
		* Grade injury\
		Commonly used classification systems include:
			* Marshall
			* Rotterdam
	* Findings:
		* DAI
		* Cerebral contusion
		* Hydrocephalus
		* Traumatic SAH/EDH/SDH
* MRI\
Not indicated routinely in the acute phase. Role in:
	* Neuroprognostication of DAI
	* Identification intracranial vascular injury

:::column-margin
Because EVD and ICP monitors contraindicate MRI; MRI is only able to be performed after these have been removed (generally 7 days) and so delayed prognostication is normal.
:::

### Marshall Classification

Grades injury into **six categories** by degree of swelling or presence of contusions.

:::column-margin
High/mixed density lesions refers to haemorrhage.
:::

+-------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| Grade | Findings                                                      |
+=======+===============================================================+
| I     | * No visible pathology                                        |
+-------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| II    | * Basal cisterns present with <5mm midline shift              |
|       | * Density (contusion) present\                                |
|       | * No high/mixed density >25mm                                 |

|       | * No high/mixed density >25mm                                 |
+-------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| V     | * Evacuated mass lesion\                                      |
|       | i.e Lesion that required surgery.                             |
+-------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| VI    | * Non-evacuable mass lesion\                                  |

: Rotterdam Classification of TBI


Rotterdam score correlates with six-month mortality in adults and children. In adults the sum score + 1 gives a mortality:

* 1. 0%
* 2. 7%
* 3. 16%
* 4. 26%
* 5. 53%
* 6. 61%


**Other**:

## Management

:::priority
* Correct hypoxia
* Maintain **cerebral perfusion**
* **↓ ICP**
* Identification and treatment of other traumatic injuries
* Transfer to a neurotrauma centre
:::

**Resuscitation**:

:::column-margin
This covers brain-specific resuscitation; the principles of Damage Control Resuscitation are covered under @sec-trauma_primary. Details of **ICP management including indications** are covered under @sec-icp_mx.
:::

* A
	* **Intubation**
		* Coma
		* Marked agitation
		* Significant extracranial trauma
* B
	* Normal **O~2~**\
	PaO~2~ 80-100mmHg.
	* Low-normal **CO~2~**\
	PaCO~2~ 35-40mmHg.
	* Lung protective ventilation\
	PEEP of 5-10cmH~2~O is appropriate; ↑↑ PEEP will ↑ CVP and ↓ cerebral venous return.
* C
	* Defend **cerebral perfusion**
		* Target SBP or CPP:\
		SBP should be targeted if ICP is not monitored, otherwise target CPP.
			* SBP target varies with age:
				* <50: SBP >110
				* 50-69: SBP >100
				* \>70: SBP >110
			* Aim **CPP 60-70mmHg** if **ICP >15mmHg**\
			Can be relaxed after 72 hours as the brain enters a hyperaemic phase, although ICP <22mmHg should still be defended.
		* Correct hypovolaemia with blood or crystalloid
		* Vasopressors appropriate once volume resuscitated
	* Invasive arterial monitoring
* D
	* **ICP monitoring** and **treatment**
		* Indicated for:
			* Severe TBI (GCS ⩽8) with:
				* Abnormal CT scan\
				Swelling, ICH, hydrocephalus, herniation.
				* Normal CT scan but ⩾2 of:
					* Age >40
					* Motor posturing
					* SBP <90mmHg
		* If monitored, ICP should be kept **<22mmHg**


**Specific therapy**:

:::column-margin
Management of intracranial pressure is covered under @sec-icp.
:::

* Pharmacological
	* ICP interventions
* Procedural
	* Evacuation of extra-axial haemorrhage
	* CSF drainage
	* Decompressive **craniectomy**
		* Primary (early) decompressive craniectomy has no role
		* Secondary (late) decompressive craniectomy for refractory ↑ ICP has a *possible* role:
			* Performed for refractory ↑ ICP
			* ↓↓ Mortality but ↑ morbidity in survivors
* Physical

:::column-margin
Late decompressive craniectomy results in:

* Significantly ↑ number and disability of survivors
* A greater number of survivors with a "favourable" outcome\
Favourable is upper severe disability (see prognosis), or better.
* A significantly greater number of survivors with severe disability or vegetative state. 
:::


**Supportive care**:

* A
	* Tracheostomy\
	Timing is controversial but is generally late as there is no clear benefit for early tracheostomy. Can be considered:
		* \>7 days once severe TBI treatment is completed
		* Neuroprognostic workup completed
		* Patient has either:
			* Reasonable chance of recovery to acceptable quality of life
			* Require rehabilitation but are unable to protect their away
* D
	* Seizure prophylaxis\
	Can be considered to prevent early (<7 days) seizures.
* E
	* **Temperature management**\
	Normothermia (35.5-36.5°C) should be maintained.
* H
	* **Thromboprophylaxis**\
	Difficult balance due to ↑ risk of thromboembolic events in TBI and bleeding risk of concomitant ICH. Consider:
		* Pneumatic calf compressors in patients without lower limb fractures
		* Regular (e.g. twice weekly) lower limb DVT ultrasound
		* Pharmacoprophylaxis in all patients unless:
			* ICH
			* Destructive pathology
			* ICP monitor or EVD in situ
		* IVC filter in patients who cannot be anticoagulated and have ↑↑↑ risk of DVT, e.g. pelvic or lower limb fractures


**Disposition**:

* Neurotrauma centre\
All severely TBI should be managed at a specialist neurotrauma centre.


**Preventative**:


### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

* Colloid fluid\
Associated with ↑ mortality.
* Hypotonic crystalloids\
Worsen cerebral oedema.
* Steroids

:::column-margin
Hartmann's and lactated Ringer's are hypotonic and should also be avoided.
:::

## Anaesthetic Considerations

## Complications

* B
	* Neurogenic pulmonary oedema\
	Sudden onset of pulmonary oedema due to ↑↑ sympathetic tone, classically **2-8 hours** following head injury.
	* Pneumonia\
	HAP/VAP, secondary to prolonged hospital stay.
* D
	* Hyperglycaemia
* G
	* Feeding\
	Basal feeding should be established by day 5.
* H
	* DVT/PE


## Prognosis

Neuroprognostication itself exceedingly difficult, and made more complex as many patients will exhibit very slow improvement. Poor prognostic factors include:

* Age
* Severity of injuries
* CT findings
* Hyperglycaemia
* Hypothermia
* **Hyperthermia**

:::column-margin
The **Glasgow Outcome Scale - Extended** (GOS-E) is commonly used to measure TBI outcome:

1. Death
2. Vegetative state\
Unaware, periods of spontaneous eye opening, persistent reflex responses.
3. Lower severe disability\
Dependent, unable to be left alone for >8 hours.
4. Upper severe disability\
Dependent, able to be left alone for >8 hours.
5. Lower moderate disability\
Independent at home, dependent outside, unable to return to work.
6. Upper moderate disability\
Independent at home, dependent outside, able to return to work with special arrangement.
7. Lower good recovery\
Some disability but able to return to work.
8. Upper good recovery\
Some deficits but not disabling.
:::

Of patients hospitalised with TBI, at 12 months:

* 27% have died
* 42% have moderate or severe disability
* 15% of remainder had persistent disability


Risk factors for post-traumatic epilepsy:

* GCS <10
* Haemorrhage\
EDH, SDH, ICH, contusion.
* Depressed skull fracture
* Penetrating head wound
* Seizure within 24 hours of injury


## Key Studies

Craniectomy:

* [DECRA](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1102077)
	* 155 adults with severe TBI within 72 hours of injury:
		* With uncontrolled ICP (>20mmHg for 15 minutes)
		* For full active treatment
		* Without spinal cord injury or intracranial mass lesions
	* Bifrontotemporoparietal craniectomy with bilateral dural opening vs standard care
		* Control group could receive "lifesaving" craniectomy at 72 hours
	* Standard ICP treatment in both groups
	* Significant ↑ (70% vs 51%) in unfavourable (GOS-E 1-4) outcomes at 6 months
	* Significant ↓ in ICP in intervention group
	* 25% of control group crossed over
* RESCUE ICP


Other:

* CRASH
