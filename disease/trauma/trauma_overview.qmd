# Trauma Overview

Trauma is physical injury occurring due to mechanical force, and is divided into:
* Blunt trauma\
Injuries are generally internal, multiple, and may not be initially obvious.
	* MVA
	* Falls
	* Assault
* Penetrating trauma\
Injuries highly dependent on trajectory and force of energy involved
	* Explosions
	* Assault
		* GSW
		* Stabbings

:::column-margin
A systematic approach of triage and assessment is required to efficiently and effectively identify and treat patients and injuries in the appropriate order.\
\
Triage and management of mass casualty scenarios are covered @sec-triage and @sec-mimms; the initial assessment and management of the trauma patient is covered under @sec-trauma_primary.

## Epidemiology

Trauma is a disease of:

* Young


* Chest trauma
	* Is usually **blunt**
	* Makes ~25% of all trauma deaths


## Chest Trauma

Rapid identification and treatment of chest trauma is critical as most life-threatening chest injuries:

Complex life-threatening injuries are usually fatal prior to arriving at hospital.
:::

* Respond to simple interventions\
Restoration of cardiopulmonary function also limits secondary injury.
* Can be identified clinically or with bedside investigation
Beside ultrasound allows diagnosis of:
	* Pneumothorax
	* Haemothorax
	* Pericardial collection

:::column-margin
The majority of injuries sought in the primary survey are chest injuries.

### Investigations

**Imaging**:

* CXR\
Majority of clinically significant injuries are identifiable on CXR.
* CT\
CT angiography allows diagnosis of particular injuries, particularly:
	* Aortic dissection
