# Burns


## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Burns are:

* Common\
~1% of persons.
	* ~10% require hospitalisation


## Pathophysiology

Thermal injury results in:

* Local response
	* Tissue damage\
	**Jacksons Model**:
		* Zone of coagulation
		* Zone of stasis\
		Compromised but viable cells.
			* Amenable to treatment
			* Have impaired blood flow
		* Zone of stasis loss
	* Inflammation
		* Fluid extravasation
			* Greatest in first **eight** hours
			* Continues up to 24 hours
* Systemic effects\
Significant when >20% BSA.
	* ↓ CO in first 24-48 hours
		* Hypovolaemia
		* ↑ Blood viscosity
		* Inflammatory soup acts as negative inotrope
	* ↑ CO after 72 hours\
	Hypermetabolic response.

Eschar:

* Burnt dermis forming a non-elastic eschar atop of skin
* Circumferential eschar formation leads to compartment syndrome compressing oedematous tissue


Electrical burns:

* High resistance tissues produce excessive heat
	* Bone generates substantial heat\
	Leads to muscular burns, leading to:
		* Rhabdomyolysis
			* Fasciotomy (in addition to escharotomy)
	* May have significant underlying tissue damage that is disproportionate to overlying features

### Aetiology

## Clinical Manifestations


Physiological response:

* Systemic inflammatory response proportional to 

### Burns Assessment

:::info
Burns are **dynamic** and will evolve and either improve or deteriorate depend on therapy
:::

Assess:

* **Depth**
	* Superficial\
	Epidermal burn.
		* Red and painful
		* Healing within 1 week
		* **Not included** in **BSA calculation**
	* Superficial dermal\
	Dermal burn.
		* **Blistering**
		* Capillary return present
		* Healing is slower
	* Deep dermal
		* Dark red\
		Cooked haemoglobin locked in tissue.
		* May not blister
		* No capillary refill
	* Full thickness
		* White/waxy/charred
		* Insensate\
		**No pain**.
		* No blisters
		* No capillary refill\
		No viable blood vessels.
		* Act as a focus for infection.
* **Size**\
Remember to exclude superficial burns.
	* Rule of 9's
		* Patient palm is 1%

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

## Management

:::priority
* **First aid** and **primary survey**
* Transfer to **burns centre**
* Fluid **resuscitation** to moderate hypovolaemia
* Appropriate **debridement** and **burn care**
:::

:::column-margin
Burn patients are trauma patients and should be evaluated as such. Details of the primary survey are covered at @sec-trauma_primary.
:::

**Resuscitation**:

* First aid
	* Remove from heat source
	* Cool the burn\
	Under tepid water for 20 minutes.
* A
* C
	* **Fluid resuscitation**\
	Required for burns >10% in children and elderly, and >15% in adults.
		* Modified Parkland formula\
		Most commonly used protocol for burns resuscitation.
			* For burns >20% BSA (or 10% in children)
			* 3mL/kg/% BSA burn to calculate first 24/24 fluid requirement
				* Use lactated ringers or CSL
				* Give half over the first **8 hours**
				* **Titrate to urine output**\
					* Aim 0.5-1mL/kg/hr in adults
					* Aim 1-2mL/kg/hr in children
		* Avoid over-resuscitation and fluid creep\
		Excessive volume leads to multiorgan complications
			* Airway occlusion
			* Pulmonary oedema
			* Abdominal compartment syndrome
		* **Consider albumin**
		* Fluid therapy is ↓ as enteral intake is ↑

:::

**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
	* Analgesia\
	Multimodal:
		* Opioid
		* Ketamine
* Procedural
	* **Escharotomy**
		* Important in:
			* Limbs\
			Compartment syndrome.
			* Chest\
			Respiratory failure.
			* Abdomen\
			Abdominal compartment syndrome.
		* Cut down to viable tissue\
		Can be performed under LA as eschar is insensate.
		* Precise location for cut is not essential
		* Tissue will 'spring' out as pressure released
	* Surgical care
		* Wound excision and debridement\
		↓ Bacterial colonisation.
		* Dressings
		* Grafting
			* May be limited by availability of unburned skin
			Skin can be re-harvested every ~2 weeks.
			* 'Meshing' skin graft allows graft to be applied to skin in a 4:1 ratio\
			Taking skin in a 'chicken-wire' fashion.
			* Cadaveric skin can be used for temporary coverage, although autologous grafting is best
			* Artificial substances:
				* Biobrane\
				Silicone and porcine collagen.
					* Temporary dressing for intermediate and deep dermal burns
					* Early application beneficial\
					Reduces tissue damage and systemic inflammatory response.
				* Biodegradable Tissue Matrix
* Physical


**Supportive care**:

:::column-margin
Burn recovery is a **hypermetabolic state**; energy expenditure may be doubled and significant amounts of trace elements are lost in wound exudate.
:::

* G
	* Nutrition
		* Feed within 12 hours
		* Trace element supplementation
* I
	* Infection monitoring
	

**Disposition**:

* Transfer to burns centre if:
	* ⩾10% BSA full thickness, ⩾5% in children
	* Burns to key areas
		* Face
		* Hands
		* Feet
		* Perineum
	* Electrical and chemical
	* Inhalational injury
	* Circumferential

**Preventative**:


### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies


## Anaesthetic Considerations

* A
	* **Airway security**\
	May be impossible to get access again.
	* Facial burns
		* Painful mask application
		* NGT/tubes
* B
	* Inhalational injury
* C
	* Arterial line\
	No NIBP on burnt skin.
	* Fluid management
	* IV access
		* Ideally through unburnt skin
* D
	* Analgesia\
	Substantial pain.
		* Multimodal
		* Early anti-neuropathics
		* Single-shot regional ideal
* E
	* **Suxamethonium contraindicated**\
	From 48 hours to 2 years.
	* **Temperature management**
		* Warm theatre\
		28°C.
		* Warming lines
		* Warming CVCs\
		Slow rate of cooling but often unsuccessful warming.
		* Abandon procedure if unmanageable hypothermia (**⩽35°C**)
	* Positioning difficult
* G
	* Hypermetabolic\
	Rapid consumption of neuromuscular blockers.
* H
	* Bleeding can be substantial\
		* Prepare for **massive transfusion**\
		Hard to overtransfuse.
			* Hb >100g/L prior to procedure ideal
			* ABG every half hour to measure Hb
		* **Tumescent preparation**\
		1:500,000 adrenaline infiltrated widely subcutaneously under sites prior to debridement results in substantial reduction in blood loss without adverse effect on graft success.
		* Bleeding will continue post-operatively
	* Coagulopathy
* I
	* Sepsis


## Complications

* D
	* Cosmetic
	* Chronic pain
* E
	* Contractures
	* Rhabdomyolysis
* F
	* AKI
		* Pre-renal
		* Haemoglobinuria
		* Myoglobinuria
	* Hypernatraemia
* I
	* Sepsis\
	Often occurs due to the combination of:
		* Deep injuries
		* Disrupted wound healing
		* Immune dysfunction
