# Blast Trauma

Explosions occur due to a rapid release of chemical energy and cause harm via three mechanisms:

* **Primary injury**\
Pressure wave causing **barotrauma** due to over-, then under-pressurisation.
	* Affects air filled organs
	* Risk with:
		* Military trauma\
		Civilian primary blast trauma is rare, and associated with:
			* Combustion of air-dust mixtures\
			Coal, grain stores.
			* BLEVE\
			Gases stored as liquids under pressure explode when heating to a temperature above their boiling point.
		* Underwater explosions
		* Explosions in enclosed spaces
* **Secondary injury**\
From projectiles propelled by the explosion.
	* Often penetrating injury
* **Tertiary injury**\
From movement of air.
	* Often blunt trauma
	* Patient being thrown into objects
	* Building collapse
* **Quaternary injury**\
Everything else:
	* Burns
	* Toxic gases
		* CO
		* CN
	* Oxygen depletion
	* Dust

Explosions produce three key effects:

* **Supersonic pressure wave**\
Rapid ↑ followed by ↓ of atmospheric pressure without mass particle movement.
	* ↑ In enclosed spaces due to reflection
* **Heat**\
Blast wind created by gases produced during the explosion.
* Gas

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## Pathophysiology

### Aetiology

## Clinical Features

Primary blast injury:

* Air filled organs
	* **Lung**
		* Pneumothorax
		* Lung contusion
		* Alveolar haemorrhage		
		* Blast lung\
		Alveolar consolidation with fluid and cellular debris.
			* May lead to alveolar-pulmonary venous fistuale and air embolism
	* Tympanic membrane rupture
	* Hollow visceral rupture
* Globe rupture
* Mild TBI


Secondary blast injury:

* Penetrating injury
* Soft-tissue trauma
* Traumatic amputation


Tertiary blast injury:

* Blunt and penetrating injury
* TBI
* Crush injury
* Entrapment


## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

**Bedside**:

**Laboratory**:

**Imaging**:

**Other**:

## Management

**Resuscitation**:

* A
	* Intubation
* B
	* Lung protective ventilation
		* Minimise Pip\
		Risk of systemic air embolism due to direct alveolar-venous communication.

**Specific therapy**:

* Pharmacological
* Procedural
* Physical

**Supportive care**:

**Disposition**:

**Preventative**:


### Marginal and Ineffective Therapies

## Anaesthetic Considerations

## Complications

* B
	* ARDS
* C
	* Air embolism
* D
	* Permanent hearing loss
	* Tinnitus
	* Abnormal vestibular function

## Prognosis

Death:

* 70% occur within 5 minutes of injury due to catastrophic:
	* Haemorrhage
	* Brain injury

## Key Studies
