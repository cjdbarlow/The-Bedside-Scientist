# Liver Trauma

Liver trauma has high potential for morbidity and mortality due to both massive haemorrhage and risk of delayed complications, and is graded:

* **Grade I**
	* Subcapsular haematoma <10% of surface area
	* Laceration <1cm deep
* **Grade II**
	* Subcapsular haematoma 10-50% of surface area
	* Intraparenchymal haematoma <10cm
	* Laceration 1-3cm deep
* **Grade III**
	* Subcapsular haematoma >50% of surface area
	* Intraparenchymal haematoma >10cm
	* Laceration >3cm deep
	* Vascular injury with bleeding contained within parenchyma
* **Grade IV**
	* Laceration with parenchymal disruption of 25-75% hepatic lobe or 1-3 segments
	* Vascular injury with bleeding into the peritoneum
* **Grade V**
	* Laceration with >75% of parenchymal disruption
	* Juxtahepatic venous injury
