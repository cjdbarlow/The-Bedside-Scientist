>Facts that are useful but don't fit cleanly into a current section

* Endocrine crises depend on the underlying condition (e.g. hypothyroidism) and a physiological stress (surgery, illness) that exacerbates that condition


* AF is a disease of disorganised conduction  
Does not relate to the presence or absence of P waves; but its relationship to the QRS.
	* Degree of atrial activity is often seen, especially in V<sub>1</sub>
	* Difficult to convert to sinus but easy to rate control

AF Mx:
* Find cause
	* Ischaemia
	* CM
	* Infection
	* Anaemia
	* TFTs
* Fix
* Control rate  
Rate control better as less strokes than rhythm control (on warfarin, different now?).
	* Rhythm control good for sick patients who need the atrial kick
* Anticoagulate

* AFlutter
	* Very shockable

* RBBB in isolation is not associated with RAD because the bulk of depolarisation is still heading to the LV

* Q waves take ~8 hours to occur after infarction
* Q waves should be ~1/3rd of the R wave it proceeds, unless infarction is occurring


* ST elevation in III > II with ST elevation in aVL suggests RCA lesion
* ST elevation in II > II with ST elevation in aVL suggests LCx lesion


* J point is 60-80ms from the deepest part of the S wave


* Upward deflections in V1<sub>1</sub> are (almost) always pathological
	* RVH  
	PHTN, PE.
	* RV infarct
	* Lead placement
	* Dextrocardia
	* RBBB
	* WPW

* QRS duration is the speed of conduction through the myocardium  
Quantifies, to a degree, the ejection fraction.
	* Short QRS; rapid & efficient conduction -> probable good ejection
	* Prolonged QRS; slow conduction -> potentially bad conduction  


* LBBB should be evaluated pre-operatively some way, especially if new, and even if asymptomatic


* Perioperative cardiac function:
	* LV function
	* Exercise tolerance


* RVOT VT spreads towards cardiac apex; has LBBB morphology  
May be able to be managed medically.
* VT with RBBB; LV source (usually myocardial scar from infarct)


* CHB risk is related to escape rhythm
	* Junctional escape suggests purkinje system intact and is relatively less urgent  
	But should be done before anaesthesia.
	* Ventricular escape suggests need for pacing


* WPW
	* Pre-excitation = short PR interval
	* Delta wave = slurring in first 50% of QRS
	* Usually okay if not in AF  
	In AF, its like having VF - unfiltered pathway conducts all the atrial activity through to the ventricle.
	* Requires class I drugs or DCC


EEG in ICU:
* Monitor burst suppression
* Diagnosis undifferentiated conscious impairment
* Diagnose NCSE
* Prognosticate hypoxic brain injury
* Early diagnosis vasospasm


Mannitol contraindications:
* Na >150
* Osm >320


Easy epilepsy loading doses:
* Phenytoin 20mg/kg
* Valproate 40mg/kg
* Levetiracetam 60mg/kg


PRBC transfusion incrementsS:
* 4ml/kg increases Hb by ~10g/L


##Midface Fractures
* Airway control important
* Blood major issue
* Laryngoscopy usually straightforward
* Then realign face
* Usually interventional radiology in first instance
* Bite blocks and splints
* Then surgery in a few days when swelling has improved


##Impact Brain Apnoea

##Cryoprecipitate & Transfusion
* 10-250mg fibrinogen in each bag  
Median 150mg.
* Give calcium every second unit of blood

##PRBC
Physiology:
* pH 6.5
* K ⩾25mmol/L


##TEG/ROTEM
* Point of care viscoelastic test for measurement of coagulation function

##Cyclical Hyper-resuscitation


##Visceral Organ Injury
* Bradycardia/lack of tachycardiac due to vagal stimulation despite inadequate organ confusion


##End-Points of Resuscitation
Values indicating critical physiological derangement include:
* Temperature ⩽35
* pH ⩾7.2
* Ionised Calcium ⩽1
* Plt ⩾50
* INR ⩾1.5
* APTT
* Fibrinogen level ⩽1



##Blood Resuscitation
Paeds: 10ml/kg of all blood product is a good guide


#Posterior fossa craniectomy
Posterior fossa craniectomy have more VAE than supine
Not much room for surgical operation
Haemodynamic instability from manipulating brainstem cardiac centres
Obstructive hydrocephalus



##Awake crani
* Patient selection, counselling
* art line and IV on ipsilateral side
* Empty bladder
* Warming blanket
* TEDS, no calf compressors
* Intra-operative awake/asleep/awake

##Coiling
Coiling:
* Remote
* Radiation
* Radiology equipment
* Heparin requirement



#Aortic stenosis echo
* Echo pressure measurements are based on velocity, cath lab based pressure measurements are based on actual pressure
* Peak velocity is based on the maximal pressure gradient, which does not occur at peak aortic pressure but on the actual upstroke of the LV
* Echo tables therefore will overestimate the degree of stenosis compared to cath lab measurements

##Mitral valve
* Anterior leaflet ~1/3 of anulus
* Posterior leaflet ~2/3 of annulus
* Omniplane:
	* 0 deg cuts A2 P2
	* 60deg cuts along commissure and gives the P3, A2, P1 view
	* 90deg cuts through A2 P3
	* 150deg cuts through P2 A2 again


##Cardioplegia
* Various types


##Radiopaedia note:
* L LL sits at base of heart down to diaphragm
* Lingula touches left heart border
* RML covers R heart border

##Anatomy of a bypass circuit



##Systemic review
* Clearly stated set of objectives with pre-defined eligibility criteria
* Explicit and reproducible methodology


#Meta analysis
* Combined results of several studies with values weighted by various quality criteria
* Funnel plot: is my study representative

##RCTs
* Obtain two similar groups, treated identically, except for intervention vs control
* Followed up identically
* Statistical difference on a predefined outcome which is clinically relevant
* Use CONSORT criteria when interpreting studies  
* 5 major questions:
	* Should this study have been performed?
		* Originality
		* Incremental
		* Significance
	* Is the methodology flawed?

##Bias
* Selection
* Performance  
Difference in care outside of the intervention.
* Detection
* Attrition
* Reporting

##Odds and risk
* RR is a ratio of rates, and expresses comparative likelihoods of events between populations
* OR is a ratio of odds, looking at relative likelihoods of events given EXPOSURES

##Post resuscitation care
CO2; aim 50-55
O2: aim low normal
Temp: 33 to 36 degrees
SBP >100
Control glucose


##Ventilation strategy
* PEEP 14-16 well tolerated and seems greatest bang for buck with damaged lung
* Automated recruitment on GE machines
* Benefit seen in ARDSnet but reversed in ROSE; probably because ventilator dyssynchrony reduced with better ventilators and ventilation modes
* PCV maximises driving pressure throughout the entire breath
	* Alveoli peak early due to high pressure gradient in proximal airway
	* Higher initial flow
	* More of Vt delivered early in inspiratory cycle
	* Vt better distributed among alveoli with different time constants


##Hyponatraemia & friends
John Reeves talk:
* Diagnose based on osmoles
* Treat based on volume
* Urinary sodium is a function of the bodies impression of its volume state
* Hiller Am J Med 1999 correcting sodium; rule of thumb; for every 3mmol/L increase in BSL the sodium will fall by 1  
Corrected sodium useful to assess total volume deficit; e.g. in DKA, look at difference between corrected sodium and normal sodium, normal sodium deficit.
* Acute kidney injuries, the urea and creatinine rise proportionally
* Chronic kidney failure, the creatinine rises disproportionately to the urea
* Random conditions, the urea will rise disproportionately to the creatinine
	* Water depletion
	* GI haemorrhage
	* Catabolism
	* Pulse steroids

Liver function:
* INR best index of rapid progression
* Albumin and globulins indicators of synthetic function
* ALP and GGT indicate duct damage
* Transaminases detect hepatocyte damage


* HCO3 should move 2mmol/L for each 10mmHg change in CO2


##Ethics
Ethical practice:
* Autonomy  
Right to make own decisions. Advanced care directive is to defend autonomy when they no longer have capacity.
	* Opposite is paternalism  
	Any restriction of a patients autonomy, motivated or presented as being justified by interest in the patients well-being.
* Beneficence  
The duty to do the best for the patient.
	* Duty to do good
	* Difficult to decide what is best?  
	Patient, doctor, hospital administration, etc.
* Non-maleficence  
Duty to do no harm.
	* Doctrine of double effect  
	Intended good effect morally outweighs negative effects, provided that negative effect is not intended, even if it is foreseen. 
		* The action itself must be morally indifferent or morally good
		* The bad effect must not be the means by which the good effect is achieved
		* The motive must be the achievement of the good effect
		* The good effect must be at least equivalent in importance to the bad effet
	* Can be tested with the **Sulmasy test**  
	e.g. IN palliative care; if the patient did not die as a result of my actions, would I feel I achieved what I set out to do? If no, then okay.
* Justice
	* Distribute justice  
	Fair distribution of scarce resources. Many ways to define fair:
		* Equal share
		* By need
		* By effort
		* By contribution
		* By merit
		* By free-market exchanges
	* Rights based justice  
	Respect for peoples rights.
* Fidelity  
Act in ways that are loyal.
	* Role fidelity  
	Act appropriately to your job.
* Utility  
Greatest good for greatest number.

#FOI Speel
I would thoroughly explain the process to the patient, that it may take some time, and the possibility of discomfort.

I would gain IV access, and give 200-400ug of glycopyrrolate IV as an antisialagogue. I would apply nasal prong oxygen and commence remifentanil TCI at 1ng/ml, titrating to patient comfort whilst ensuring they remain spontaneously ventilating.

For nasal FOI, I would:
* Identify the most patent nostril
* Ensure I am not using more than 9mg/kg lignocaine total
* Spray the nostril with 1-3 sprays of cophenylcaine
* Serially dilate with NPAs
	* From a small size up to 0.5 size above the intended tube size
	* Using lignocaine 2% viscous gel on the first NPA
	* Using copious lubricant on the other NPAs
* Whilst dilating, I would spray 10% lignocaine via MAD over 5 minutes, targeting the:
	* Oropharynx
	* Tonsillar pillars
	* Base of tongue
* Load Parker Flex tube onto the bronch
* Use ETT as an introducer for bronchoscope into nasopharynx
* Advance bronchoscope into oropharynx and identify glottis
* Use 2% lignocaine spray-as-I-go to anaesthetise larynx
* Spray into trachea to anaesthetise carina
* Advance bronchoscope to carina
* Advance tube over bronchoscope
* Secure airway and confirm ventilation with CO2 monitoring
* Commence anaesthesia


For oral FOI, I would:


##Aintree
* 4.7mm ID (fits a 4mm bronch)
* 6.5mm OD (fits a 7.0 tube)
* 56cm long

##Exam Stuff
Overall:
* Impossible to completely prepare
* Odds are in your favour
* Likely that blue book won't cover MCQs but may cover vivas
	* Blue book 2017 will be about right though...

MCQ and SAQ:
* **ANZCA networks high yield**
	* Anaesthesia learning module?
* Review questions and vivas over the last 2 years; highly likely MCQs and SAQs will relate to these topics
* One examiner marks each question  
Random double-marker.
	* Illegibility, spelling errors are penalised by examiner frustration
* Questions aimed to be answered in ~8 minutes
	* Generally easy to get the main points
	* Time management important
	* Low yield after the main points
* Recent questions from FRCA and CICM good for vogue topics

Med viva:
* Should mostly be chronic stable disease
* Rarely acute
* Almost never a DDx
* Patients tend to be institionalised and pretty good historians
* Scoring systems (NYHA etc) are good, but if not applicable to your disease then score based on their functional impact
* Sometimes a bit chaotic on day due to nature of patients, so less standardised than usual
* Want an organised, empathic, listening approach to patient and getting information relevant to you as an anaesthetist
* Respect and rapport with the patient is vital and "you will be punished severely" if you cause pain or are not respectful
* Wear suit and tie or equivalent
* Stem on door will direct you to a system; focus on that system first and then and only then go outside of that system if it is relevant and you have time
* In general questions shouldn't focus on perioperative issues, but that may happen with weird shit because they don't know what else to talk about
* Investigations are a big part of this exam
	* More detail on spirometry including MMEF, peak and end expiratory flow, shape of waveform and why (seem to want more detail than most of the online resources have)
	* Lead with the big stuff up front (e.g. there is a massive anterior STEMI), and then go through the detailed bit -> normally they will cut you off if you got the major things
* Most common mistake is failure to listen to the patient

Trends in people who fail:
* Haven't used ANZCA networks
* Haven't used the taxonomy for SAQs
* Lack of organisation

Vivas:
* Three areas to work through
* Make decision and justify your management
* Avoid diving too deep too soon
* Admit ignorance if complex cases that you haven't done  
"I haven't done this but I am aware of these issues (list), and would seek advice of a senior and experienced colleague"
* Grab lifelines when offered
* Don't dive into crisis mode inappropriately early; demonstrates not ready for independent practice


##TOE
Goal & good at:
* Demonstrate anatomical aspects of valvular pathology
* Provide assurance that surgical technique successful
* Haemodynamic monitoring
* Anatomical monitoring
	* AV, MV, TV
	* Base of heart


Not so good at:
* Visualising
	* PV
	* Apex
* Physiology  
Requires anaesthetic and therefore changes physiology from patients usual loading conditions.
	* Regurgitant lesions appear better due to reduced afterload
	* Aortic stenosis  
	Appear less severe because reduced contractility.
	* Grading severity  
	Good at looking at WHY a lesion exists, once the physiology is graded on TTE.


Demonstrated use:
* When a cardiac chamber is opened:
	* Valve repair
	* Congenital cardiac
	* HOCM
	* Endocarditis
* Dissection
* Unexplained severe hypotension


Maybe used:
* Lung transplant
* Liver transplant
* Major non-cardiac with severe symptomatic haemodynamic response


Diastolic function assessment:
* Grades
	* Normal
	* Grade I/impaired relaxation	
	Relaxing more slowly than normal but no compensatory rise in LAP. Is normal in >65 year olds.
	* Grade II/pseudonormal  
	Slowly relaxing ventricle but some compensation by a moderate rise in LAP.
	* Grade III/restrictive filling  
	Severe relaxation failure accommodated by high LAP and LV remodelling.
	* Grade IV/fixed  
	Severe unfixable relaxation failure
* Measurement
	* Pulse wave doppler through tips of mitral valve leaflets
	* Gives E/A
		* E wave
			* Pressure gradient between LA and LV  
			High with:
				* High LV negative pressure
				* High LA filling pressure
		* A wave
			* Pressure gradient generated by atrial contraction and LV
			* Atria has no valves and is pretty weak so can only generate ~5mmHg of additional pressure
		* Normally, atrial kick is more important and so A usually > E, i.e. E/A <1
		* With deterioration:
			* Grade I: LVEDP increases, which reduces diastolic filling (smaller E wave) but atrial kick still relatively reasonably decent, and so E/A reversal occurs (A bigger than E)
			* Grade II: LAP (filling) pressures increase so gradient is restored. Atria is still a little bitch and so its contribution is relatively small against the increased LV DP so E>A. Looks "normal" from a FLOW point of view on echo, but the pressures are higher.
				* Valsalva will reduce LA filling pressures, which will restore "normal" filling pressures and therefore E phase filling is reduced and A>E again. This allows pseudonormal to be differentiated from grade I dysfunction.
			* Grade III: E wave becomes progressively larger as LAP increases, and A wave becomes smaller because the little bitch atrium can't contract against such high LV pressures.
			* Grade IV:
			* As ventricle gets stiffer, its diastolic filling time reduces because it distends so quickly. E wave duration shortens because the ventricle fills (and stops filling) so quickly.
		* E/E'
			* E': Velocity of submitral myocardium in early diastole; measured at septum and lateral wall (septum usually lower). Indicates how fast the ventricle is relaxing. Related to:
				* How well the LV is relaxing (sucking)
				* How hard the filling pressure is pushing (blowing)
			* E/E' accounts for the blowing portion to better estimate the sucking


Aortic stenosis:
* DI
	* Least assumptions
	* Probably the most accurate, barring issues with CW doppler (e.g. outflow tract obstruction)
* AVA
	* Derived from DI
* MPG  
Can be a function bad AS (high gradient) or bad LV function (low gradient). Compare with DI and stress TTE?


LV function:
* EF
* FS
* GLS
	* Integrated measurement of change in length of myocardium
	* -18 normal, less negative is worse (less movement)



##NIRS
Cerebral oximetry:
* Principles similar to pulse oximetry and spatial resolution
* Algorithmically correct for saturation of extracranial blood
* Values are derived mainly from venous blood and are independent of pulsatile blood flow
* Use
	* Collect baseline prior to induction  
	Usual is 60-80%.
	* Factors affecting oxygenation:
		* Cerebral blood flow
			* CO
			* Acid-base
			* Haemorrhage
			* Arterial inflow/venous outflow
		* Oxygen content
			* [Hb]
			* Hb saturation
			* Lung function
			* FiO2
	* Optimise based on the above factors
	* Reduction of 12-20% from baseline suggests brain ischaemia
* Limitations
	* Extracranial blood saturation
	* Diathermy
	* Only measures regional saturation
	* Don't detect cause

##Blood Gas Corrections
2 and 4 are just as good and easier to remember.
i.e. for every 10 change in CO2, bicarb will chagne acutely by 2 and chronically by  4.

# Problem Statements
## Cardiac tamponade
Primary goals are to avoid haemodynamic collapse and expedite decompression.

### Avoid haemodynamic collapse
- Full, fast, maintain contractility and SVR
- Arterial line
- Volume line available to maintain preload
- Vasopressor infusion to avoid excessive hypotension
- If critical (cannot lie flat): spontaneously ventilating induction to avoid PPV and increase in RV afterload, and reduce instability associated with rapid induction

### Minimise surgical time
- Prepped and draped preinduction
- Plan for urgent thoracotomy if arrests

## Severe Pulmonary Hypertension
Greatest risk of anaesthetic mortality. Keys are to accurately assess RV function, optimise perioperatively, defend RV function, avoid raised PVR.

### RV function assessment
- PAP more useful as long-term prognostic indicator than anaesthetic prognostic indicator
- Clinical: Exercise tolerance, peripheral oedema, congestive hepatopathy
- Echo: Systolic function (TAPSE, radial), diastolic dysfn (dilation, RAE)

### Perioperative optimisation
- Fluid state (diuresis to optimal preload)
- Pulmonary vasodilators

### Defend RV
- CVC and transduce; CVP rising -> failing
- Arterial line
- Vasopressor infusion
- Defend RV perfusion pressure
- Consider TOE/PAC

### Avoid raised PVR
- Normoxia
- Avoid hypercarbia
- Optimise FRC and PEEP/avoid atelectasis
- Control pain
- Avoid acidosis
- Avoid hypothermia

## AFOI
Requires adequate time and a compliant patient; key domains are sedation, topicalisation, and technical skill/equipment.

### Sedation
- I prefer judicious sedation with immediately reversible agents
- Requirement decreased with good patient preparation and expectation management
- 0.25-0.5mg midazolam
- Fentanyl 25ug increments

### Topicalisation
- Antisialagogue with glycopyrrolate 200-400ug
- Lignocaine up to 9mg/kg
- For nasal: 
 - Cophenylcaine to most patent nostril, then serial dilation with lubricated NPAs up to 0.5 intended tube size, using 2% lignocaine viscous gel as lubricant on first NPA.
 - Bulk of remainder of lignocaine via MAD to oropharynx, tonsillar pillars, and base of tongue
 - Spray cords and proximal trachea prior via tube with 2ml 2% in 5ml syringe
- For PO
 - Spray with MAD as above
 - Ensure to move tip down to spray cords (spray with inhale)
 - Test with tip or OPA

### Technical skill
- Position; sitting from front
- Nasal: Easier, bleeding, better tolerated, not as good long term
- Oral: Harder, better for ICU/tube exchange
- Bullet tip tube
- Nasal: Assistant with gauze on tongue, pull forward
- PO: Use Berman or ovassapian to keep scope and tube in midline


## DLT insertion
- Intubate and connect tube
- Confirm tracheal placement with CO2
- Confirm correct side with scope to identify RUL bronchus trifurcation
- Inflate bronchial cuff under vision
- Clamp isolated side and open lumen to air
 - Feel for gas leak from isolated side
 - Check for drop in Vt on vent (PCV)
 - If uncertain or unclear, auscultate and recheck with bronch


## Unsecured Aneurysm
Priorities are to prevent aneurysm rupture by avoiding changes in transmural pressure, avoid increased ICP, and manage complications of SAH.

### Transmural pressure
- Avoid swings in MAP and HR
- Gentle induction with remi, props, vasopressor
- Tit
- Key phases include intubation, pinning, bone off, and dura opening


### Avoid increased ICP
- Position: Head up, tape not tie
- Ventilation: CO2, PEEP
- Drugs: Sedation, muscle relaxant, osmotic agents

### Complications
- Hydrocephalus
- Arrhythmia
- Vasospasm


## Laryngeal fracture
Critical situation. Principles are to maintain spontaneous ventilation, and secure the airway below the level of the injury

### Spontaneous ventilation
- Avoid PPV

### Secure
- Aim awake surgical trache
- Cric and percutaneous techniques not ideal
- Failing that secure from the top with VAFI; i.e. intubate under direct vision
- Tits up -> RSI and pray

## Severe pre-eclampsia
Key goals are care of mother and care of baby. Priorities are expedite delivery, control BP, seizure prophylaxis, care for baby.

### Expedite delivery
- Urgent C/S
- GA may be required
- Goals of induction are to secure riskier/unfasted airway rapidly whilst avoiding hypertension, recognising the prime killer of these patients is ICH due to hypertensive induction

### Control BP
- Rapid to <160 and slower thereafter
- IV agents: labetalol 2.5-10mg IV, hydralazine 5-10mg
- PO: Nifedipine

### Seizure prophylaxis
- 4g MgSO4/20 min; 1g/hr thereafter for 24/24

### Baby
- CTG
- Paediatricians
- Intrauterine resus PRN


## Myasthenia Gravis
Major concerns are bulbar, respiratory, cardiac, and skeletal muscle; as well as avoiding crises.

## Bulbar
- Aspiration risk

## Respiratory
- Post op respiratory dysfunction
- May need HDU depending on degree of restrictive defect

## Cardiac
- Myositis
- Anterior mediastinal mass (thymomas)

## Skeletal
- Muscle relaxants:
 - Sux resistant
 - Non-depolarising sensitive; use 1/10th of dose, monitor, sugammadex

## Crises
- Cholinergic: Excess ACh leading to parasympathetic (SLUDGE) and weakness. Intubate and give atropine.
- Myasthenic: Weakness due to inadequate ACh, exacerbated by physiological stress. Pyridostigmine.


## Rheumatoid
Concerns relate to:

### Neck mobility

### Extra-articular manifestations
- Respiratory: ILD
- Cardiac: Myopathy

### Immunosuppression from therapy


# Stress Dose Steroids
* Glucocorticoids >5mg/day can cause HPA axis supression
* All glucocorticoid dependent patients are at risk of adrenal crisis due to surgical or physiological stress
* Hydrocortisone 100mg IV bolus
	* Tapering dose if high physiological stress/major surgery/labour
	* Single shot for more minor procedures/bowel prep
* Dexamethasone is inadequate due to lack of mineralocorticoid activity
* Children are more vulnerable
* Risk factors
	* Any comorbidity  
	Any disease increases risk.
	* Asthma
	* Diabetes


# Open Disclosure
Open disclosure describes the way clinicians communicate with and support patients, and their family and carers who have experienced harm during healthcare. Open disclosure is:
* A patient right
* Anchored in professional ethics
* Considered good clinical practice
* Part of the continuum of care


Principles:
* Open
* Timely
* Acknowledged to the patient
* Apology
* Support to patient and family
* Support to healthcare providers
* Integrated clinical risk management and systems improvement
* Good governance
* Confidentiality

Open disclosure consists of:
* An apology  
Without speculation, or apportioning blame, and including the words "I am sorry".
* A factual explanation of what happened
* An opportunity for the patient, family, and carers to relate to the experience
* A discussion of the potential consequences
* An explanation of the steps being taken to manage the adverse event


Current findings:
* Most effective as an ethical practice that prioritises individual and organisations learning from error, rather than solely as an operational risk management strategy
* Fosters cultures of openness and trust
* Patients prefer an open dialogue compared to didactic delivery of information
* Health professionals are supportive but concerns remain
	* Perceived medio-legal consequences
	* Preparedness required
	* Tensions between open and timely acknowledgement


## No Harm Incidents
In errors where no apparent harm has occurred, clinicians can only be certain by discussing the incident with the patient. Indiscriminate disclosure of near-misses and no-harm incidents is not feasible; and disclosure should be guided by:
* Will the distress or psychological harm of disclosing the error outweigh the benefit that could be obtained by the disclosure?
* Will disclosure reduce the risk of future incidents?
* Will disclosure maintain patient, family, and carer trust in the service?

# Crainiotomy ICP physiology
ICP falls when dura opened
Sympathetic driven hypertension may precipitously resolve
Ends up very hypotensive 
May have dramatic response to vasopressors
Avoid with good filling and ablate sympathetically driven hypertension with opioids so the response is less dramatic


<<<<<<< Updated upstream
#Echo for Transcatheter interventions
* ASA recommendationds 2011

TAVI:
* Several types of valve
* Medtronic Corevalve inflates higher in the root
	* Valve struts extend into the asecneding aorta
* Sapien
	* Positioned at the site of native AV
* Echo
	* Confirm diagnosis
	* Assess LV  
	Basal septal hhypertrophy increases difficulty.
	* Measure aortic annular junction
	* Distance from coronary ostia to aortic annulus  
	<12mm is an issue with Sapien valves.
	* Deployment
		* Ventricular side of valve positioned at IVF but not esxtending past AMVL
			* MR if too ventricular
			* Coronary occlusion if too aortic
	* Paravalvular leak
		* >Mild inccreased mortality
		* Assess AV in ME and TG views
		* TAVI leak usually posterior
		* Graded by circumferential involvement (how much of the valve clock face is invovled) in SAX
			* Moderate 10-20%
		* Flow reversal in descending aorta

EP:
* Atrial septal puncture
	* Fossa ovalis
	* Avoid injury to surrounding structures

ASD:
* Measure defect in 3mm
* Need defect <35mm with >5mm circumferential margins

# Aortic Valve
* Congenital uni/bicuspid valves: Post-stenotic dilatation
* Biscuspid most common
* Discrepancies between measures of AS severity
	* AS <4 and AVA < 1
		* Check LBVOT diameter
		* Check LVOT velocity signal for distance from valve
		* Calculated indexed AVA if <135cm or BMI <22
	* AS >4 and AVA >1
		* Probably high output state

# AF in pregnancy
Youssef’, “Management of Atrial Fibrillation during Pregnancy.”

* Electrical cardioversion if unstable
* Cardioversion if ongoing risk to mother or foetus
	* Preference for anticoagulation prior
	* Flecainide or ibutilide for cardioversion
	* Amiodarone associated with many adverse foetal outcomes
* VKAs should be avoided between 6-12 weeks and after week 36
	* LMWH or UFH over this period
* Rhythm control preferred
=======
# Mitral Valve 

Anatomy:
* IVF == aortomitral curtain
* Key relationships
	* LCx
	* Coronary sinus

* Saddle shaped
	* AP axis is high (WRT atrium)
	* Lateral/commissural axis is low and long (and imaged in the commissural view)

* PML has twice the annular attachment as AML
* PML has two scallops that provide pleating mechanism; as the annular circumference reduces during systole
* PMs are orientated towards the commissures
	* Both papillary muscles supply both leaflets

Key views:
* Long axis
	* Minor axis
	* Should be able to identify IVF
	* Leaflet length is true leaflet length
* Commissural view
	* Useful because its easy to be sure what you are looking at
	* Identification of location of regurgitant jets is important
	* Perpendicular to long axis view

* Both should be lined up such that there is a line perpendicular to the annulus runs through the apex

Less useful views:
* Less useful because there are limited anatomical references
* 2 chamber
* 4 chamber
	* Oblique to axis of valve
	* Measurements are unreliable
	* Advancing or withdrawing probe alters measurements

Rheumatic MS:
* Pressure half time  
On long cycle

MR:
* Restricted asymmetrical leaflet motion: Towards affected side
* Excessive leaflet motion: Away from affected side
* PM rupture gives chaotic MR


Tenting:
* Many measurements
* Tenting height >1cm (normal ~0) is significant leaflet tethering


# RV
Segments:
* Anterior
* Inferior
* Lateral
* RVOT

Function:
* Radial vs longitudinal
* Regionality
	* Basal
	* Free wall
	* RVOT
* Tricuspid annulus reduces by ~25% in systole which contributes to competence


Measurement:
* Maximised width
* TAPSE ignores free wall/septum/RVOT; and is reduced in TR and useless post TA
* FAC ignores RVOT

# Fevers

Patterns:
* Diurnal variation: infection
* Sustained: Gram -ve pneumonia/CNS damage
* >48/24 after ETT: VAP
* 5-7 postoperatively: Abscess
* 10-14 post ABx: Fungal

* Sepsis
	* 10% hypothermic
	* 35% normothermic

Causes:
* Infectious
	* VAP
	* Sinusitis
	* CLABSI
	* Gram -ve bacteraemia
	* C diff
	* Abdominal sepsis
	* Wound infectgions

* Noninfectious
	* Should be <39 degrees unless drug or transfusion related
	* ETOH/drug withdrawal
	* Post-operative  
	Probably not atelectasis.
	* Cerebral infarction
	* Adrenal insufficiency
	* MI
	* Pancreatitis
	* Acalculous cholecystitis
	* Ischaemic gut
	* Aspiration pneumonitis
	* ARDS
	* SAH
	* Fat emboli
	* Transplant rejection
	* DVT/PE
	* Gout
	* Haematoma
	* Cirrhosis
	* UGIB
	* Phlebitis
	* IV contrast reaction
	* Neoplastic fevers
	* Decubitus ulcers

Active cooling increases VO2, adrenaline, and noradrenaline levels

* Norad; avoid higher than 0.5ug/kg/min
* Vasopressin
* Methylene blue 1-2mg/kg  
Contraindications:
	* G6PD deficiency
	* SSRI/SNRI/MAOI preop
* Hydroxycobalamin 5g IVPB over 15 minutes
* AT II 10-40ng/kg/min

# Diuretics
* Multisegment nephron blockade is associated with increased diuretic response without worsening electrolyte abnormalities or renal function and may reduce RRT for volume need
	* Acetazolamide 250mg Q8H
	* Frusemide 200mg IV Q6H
	* Metolazone 10mg Q12H
	* Spironolactone 100mg PO BD

# Perioperative neurological injury
Incidence of clinically apparent stroke:
* Closed chamber: 1-2%
* Open: 4-13%

Subtle changes:
* Up to 60%, 2 months for subtle neurological dysfunction

Risk factors:
* Patient factors
	* As per other CVA
	* Carotid disease
* Operative diseases
	* Hypethermia
	* Open chamber
	* Hypotension or HDx instability

At risk periods:
* Induction of hypothermia
* Cannulation
* Rewarming

## Selective cerebral perfusion
* Can I cannulate somewhere where I can perfuse the brain?
* How long will it take to re-establish perfusion
* DHCA inflection: 20-40 minutes

* 10% dont have an intact circle of willis
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

# Mitral regurgitation
* Perioperative about evaluating location, aetiology, mechanism; not severity
* ?SAM if degenerative disease
* ? degree of leaflet tethering
* Leaflet classification most important for posterior segments because these are defined by the leaflet scallops; A segment defined WRT these
* Restricted Towards (RT); Excessive Away (EA)
* Vena contracta measured perpendicular to coaptation point; this is MO LAX. Scan for the narrowest part of the widest jet

* Secondary MR has universallly poorer outcomes compared to other causes

# MS
Rheumatic and cheaters
* Rheumatic: subvalvular apparatus thickening has significant contribution to obstucting flow


# Diastology
* Begins when the dP/dT becomes negative


# ACHD 
General approaches:
* Draw cardiac diagram with saturations and prssures at different areas
* Avoid air bubbles in all IV catheters
* PVR, SVR, and PVR/SVR modification is important; done with drugs and medications
