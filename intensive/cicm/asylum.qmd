# Asylum Seekers

CICM and ANZICS believe that:

* Access to healthcare is a basic human right
* Conditions in on-shore, off-shore, and regional processing centres should not compromise the health of asylum seekers
* Prolonged detention and uncertainty may cause long-term, severe negative health outcomes
* Detaining children can have profound detrimental impacts on the health and development of this already highly vulnerable group
