# Selective Digestive Decontamination

**Prophylactic enteral** administration of **non-absorbable antibiotics** with the aim of **eradicating potentially pathogenic** oral and intestinal **organisms** in order to **↓ nosocomial infection**.

## Indications

* Patients at risk of nosocomial infection
* ICU with low rate of resistance to chosen antimicrobial cocktail

## Contraindications

* Concern of ↑ antimicrobial resistance, although this has not been demonstrated

:::column-margin
Demonstrating resistance is difficult however - this may occur over medium-to-long scale timelines, and the efficacy of decontamination and the significance of resistance is plausibly highly dependent on local fauna and biograms.
:::

## Principles

In the critically ill:

* Overgrowth of normal and abnormal flora occurs
* Gut overgrowth heralds endogenous infections 
* Nosocomial infections are predominantly caused by endogenous flora


## Practice

:::info
Protocols vary, however the general principle is to cover Gram negatives and fungi with poorly-absorbed agents.
:::

Consider regular:

* Antimicrobial cocktail\
e.g. Q6H:
	* Colistin 100mg
	* Tobramycin 80mg
	* Nystatin
* Surveillance cultures


## Complications

* Antimicrobial resistance

## Key Studies

Evidence suggests:

* Possible immediate individual benefit:
	* ↓ Mortality
	* ↓↓ VAP\
	By ~70%.
	* No ↑ *C. difficile* infection
* Unclear long-term harms
* Significant variability based on the population studied\
Rates of nosocomial infection and local antimicrobial resistance.
