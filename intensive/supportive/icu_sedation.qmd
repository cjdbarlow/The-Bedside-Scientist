# Sedation

Sedation is a mainstay of intensive care therapy, with a large array of choices. 

## Principles


## Practice

There is little evidence supporting any one therapy, however options include:

* **Propofol**\
0-300mg/hr.
	* Easily titrated
	* May precipitate hypotension
	* Risk of hypertriglyceridaemia and propofol infusion syndrome\
	Dose related.
* **Dexmedetomidine**\
0-1.4μg/kg/min.
	* Consider load of 1μg/kg over 10 minutes if required
	* Minimal suppression of respiration
	* 
* Benzodiazepines
