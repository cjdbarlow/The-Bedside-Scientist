# Physiotherapy

Roles of physiotherapy in the ICU:

* Respiratory physiotherapy
	* Therapeutic hyperinflation\
	Aims to ↑ recruitment and ↓ airway resistance. Can be:
		* Manual\
		Use self-inflating circuit to deliver >150% of Vt.
		* Ventilator-assisted\
		Use ventilator to ↑ Vt by 200mL increments until Pip of 40cmH~2~O.
	* Active Cycle of Breathing Technique\
	Controlled breathing to ↑ secretion clearance in spontaneously ventilating patients.
	* Suction\
	Remove secretions via ETT.
	* Chest shaking\
	Oscillatory movement during expiration ↑ mucociliary clearance.
	* Positioning\
		* Sitting up to optimise V/Q matching
		* Gravity-assisted positioning\
		Adjust patient to position bronchopulmonary segment perpendicular to gravity to ↑ secretion drainage.
		* Side-to-side turning\
		↓ VAP.
		* Proning\
		↑ Oxygenation and ↓ mortality in ARDS.
* Early rehabilitation\
Aims to ↑ independence and ↓ severity of ICU-acquired weakness. Techniques exist for:
	* Bed\
	Cycle ergometry, passive movements, electrical stimulation, hoisting.
	* Chair\
	Postural exercises, balance and proprioception, core stability.
	* Standing\
	Marching, stairs, walking.
* Positioning aids\
↓ Contracture formation.


## Key Studies

* [TEAM](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2209083)
	* 750 adult ventilated ICU patients
	* Early mobilisation versus usual care
		* Early mobilisation: highest level of activity for the longest time on the lowest amount of sedation
		* Usual care still included reasonably early mobilisation
	* No significant mortality difference
	* Standing and walking occurred 1-2 days earlier in the early mobilisation group
	* More adverse events in the early mobilisation group
