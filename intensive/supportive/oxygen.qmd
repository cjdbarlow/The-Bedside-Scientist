# Oxygen Targets

## Key Studies

* [PILOT](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2208415)
	* ~3000 mechanically ventilated ICU patients from one ICU in Tennessee
	* FiO~2~ adjusted to maintain target oxygen saturation in 3 groups:
		* Low: SpO~2~: 88-92%\
		Average saturation was 93%; FiO~2~ â†“ to minimum of 0.21.
		* Intermediate: 92-96%\
		Average saturation 94%.
		* High: 96-100%\
		Average saturation 97%.
	* No significant difference in days alive and free of mechanical ventilation
	* No difference in pre-specified secondary endpoints
	* Reasonable group separation
