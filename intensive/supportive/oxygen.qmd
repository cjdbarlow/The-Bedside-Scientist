# Oxygen Targets

Supplemental oxygen administration is an universal supportive ICU treatment, which:

* **↑ PAO~2~**, and **SpO~2~** in the setting of:
	* Alveolar hypoventilation
	* Diffusion limitation
	* V/Q scatter
* Causes **absorption atelectasis** and ↑ shunt
* ↑ Oxygen free radicals, which may precipitate ap
## Principles

Aim to minimise the harm by balancing concerns of hypoxia and hyperoxia:

* Overly-conservative target
	* Organ dysfunction
	* ↑ ICP
	* ↑ PAP
* Overly-liberal target
	* Reperfusion injury
		* ↑ Infarct size in:
			* AMI
			* Stroke
	* ↓ Seizure threshold
	* ARDS


## Practice

* General ICU
	* Titrate to SpO~2~ 93-97%\
	↑ SpO~2~ not helpful, and hides signs of deterioration.
* Specific populations\
	* Minimise supplemental oxygen\
	More conservative approach favoured in groups where ↑ significantly harm with liberal oxygen:
		* STEMI
		* Paraquat poisoning
		* Bleomycin exposure
	* Targeted or tolerated hyperoxia\
	Groups where hyperoxia is therapeutic, or any hypoxia may be detrimentaL
		* CO poisoning
		* Simple pneumothorax
		* Severe pulmonary hypertension
* FiO~2~ challenge\
A failure to significantly increment SpO~2~ in response to ↑ FiO~2~ is diagnostic of a shunting pathology.

:::column-margin
Excessive supplemental oxygen may mask deterioration in pulmonary function, as a fall in SpO~2~ will only manifest once the P/F ratio has fallen to a dangerous degree.
