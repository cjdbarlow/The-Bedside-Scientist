# Organ Donation {#sec-organdonation}

:::info
This is specific to organ donation in the Australian context.
:::

:::column-margin
This covers medical elements of organ donation. Discussing organ donation with family is covered in @sec-donorconvo.
:::

There are several principles that guide the process of organ donation in the Australian context, that arise from various bodies:

* Legislature
	* Organ donation should be an unconditionally altruistic and non-commercial act
	* Organ donation is an opt-out process\
	Evidence is unclear if changing to an opt-in model ↑ donation.
* ANZICS
	* No financial benefit should occur to any organisation or person from organ donation
	* Conditional donation should be refused\
	Family request that donation only goes to a certain sort of individual (positive condition) or not to a certain sort (negative condition).
	* Directed donation is permissible under certain circumstances\
	Donation after death of organs to a named individual.
	* Irrespective of patient's known wishes, the family should be contacted to discuss donation and donation should not proceed if the family does not agree
	* Tissue donation should be offered to the family of all dying patients in the hospital

## Principles

Organ donation:

* **Should not** be raised **prior to family understanding** of death or impending death
* **Should not** be raised **prior** to medical **consensus** for **end-of-life** care
* **Should be discussed** with **donation staff**, *prior* to discussion with family
* **Should be discussed** with **all families** where it is a possibility
	* Any information contained on the organ donor register should also be communicated to family

## Suitability

:::tick
All patients near to the end of life should be referred for consideration of organ donation.
:::

**Suitability** for organ donation **is**:

* **Highly dynamic**\
Varies with recipient/waiting list requirements. 
* **Without fixed criteria**\
Diseases commonly (but not exclusively) considered contraindications include:
	* Malignancy
	* Active infection
		* Meningococcal
		* Hepatitis
		* HIV


## Death

Donation can occur after:

* **Brain death**\
Forms 75-90% of total donors, and considered in patients proceeding towards brain death.
* **Circulatory death**\
Considered in ventilated patients in whom life-sustaining treatment is to be withdrawn, and death is likely to occur in a period that permits organ retrieval for transplantation.
	* The decision for DCD should:
		* Only be considered after consensus reached that active treatment is no longer in the patients interest
		* Not include any member of the donation, transplant, or retrieval teams
		* Not influence the administration of sedatives or analgesics
		* Be raised with a family when:
			* End of life care is proceeding
			* The family are in favour of organ donation
			* The patient is likely to become brain dead, but has not yet done so
	* Leads to **warm ischaemic time**\
	Period during which the organs are still warm, but hypoperfused following circulatory death. Warm ischaemic time is:
		* The time from circulatory arrest to the time of perfusion with cold preservation solution during retrieval
		* Related to the **agonal time**\
		Time from cessation of cardiorespiratory support until circulatory arrest. An agonal time **>90 minutes** usually **precludes donation**, and **occurs** in ~**30%** of patients.
		* Related to the **functional warm ischaemic time**\
		Time from SBP <50mmHg to the time of cold perfusion.
		* Associated with ↑ complications and ↓ graft function:
			* Delayed graft function
			* Primary graft dysfunction
			* Organ-specific ischaemia
				* Biliary strictures

:::column-margin
Acceptable warm ischaemic times vary depending on the organ:

* Liver, pancreas: <30 minutes warm ischaemic time
* Heart: <30 minutes from SBP <90 mmHg to cold perfusion
* Kidneys: <60 minutes functional warm ischaemic time
* Lungs: <90 minute functional warm ischaemic time

: Comparison of Recipient Outcomes after Donation

### Antemortem Intervention

Interventions to ↑ organ viability are appropriate if:

* The patient wanted to be an organ donor
* The family has made an informed decision, and consent obtained
* The interventions do not shorten life or compromise care
* Measures are taken to prevent pain or discomfort

### Process

1. Routine referral of all patients who are likely to die for suitability of organ donation\
This includes checking the organ donation register to ascertain the patients wishes.
2. Discussion with the family (and rarely, patient, if competent) that the patient is likely to die
	* In DBD, this may be raising the chance of brain death having occurred and the need to perform further testing to confirm this
	* In DCD, this may include discussion of futility of continuing treatment
	* The organ donation nurse should be invited to attend this meeting
		* This allows them to get to know and build rapport with the family
		* They are best introduced as a "specialist nurse" rather than an organ donation specialist if organ donation has not yet been raised
2. Determination of suitability of organ donation\
By the intensivist and donation team.
3. Discussion with the family about organ donation\
A separate conversation from the end of life conversation, which includes:
	* Donation process
	* Formal consent
	* If relevant, discussing:
		* Coronial consent
		* DCD
			* Risk of a failed donation if agonal time exceeded
			* Determination of death
		* DBD
			* The patient looks the same afterwards\
			Warm, "breathing".
4. Donor assessment
	* Blood
	* Tissue typing
	* Other tests as suitable
5. Retrieval and transplant team meeting\
	* Brief discussion of the relevant details of the donors
	* Discussion of the recipients
	* Logistical plan
6. For DCD, the withdrawal of cardiorespiratory support
	* Negotiation of time and place\
	May occur:	
		* In ICU:
			* Family can be with the patient at time of death
			* Patient does not have to be moved if agonal time exceeded
			* Rapid transfer to the OR is required following death\
			May introduce delays that limit organ donation.
		* In OR:
			* Limit family presence
			* ↑ Speed of retrieval
		* Near the OR\
		Hybrid approach of the above.
	* Appropriate prevision of sedation and analgesia\
	Should be given by the intensivist, and not by the anaesthetist or transplant team.
	* The surgical team should not be present in the ICU
7. Organ retrieval
8. Transfer of the donor to the mortuary\
The donor will "look dead: afterwards; donors generally look the same on transfer to the OR.
10. Transfer of organs to the transplant centre
11. Implantation
