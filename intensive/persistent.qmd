# Persistent Critical Illness

Persistent critical illness occurs when a patients current reason for ICU is more related to their ongoing critical illness than their original reason for ICU admission. These patients:

* Have a high mortality
* Have a lower chance of returning to independent living
* Consume a large and disproportionate amount of hospital resources\
Long-stay ICU patients comprise **~5% of** ICU **patients** but **30% of** ICU **bed-days**.
* Are relatively under-researched

* Delirium
* Depression
* Critical illness weakness
* Physio

* Pressure areas

* Infection
