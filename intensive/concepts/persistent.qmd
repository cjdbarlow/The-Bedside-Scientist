# Persistent Critical Illness

Persistent critical illness occurs when a patients current reason for ICU is more related to their ongoing critical illness than their original reason for ICU admission. These patients:

* Have a high (~25%) mortality
* Have a lower chance (~46%) of being discharged home
* Consume a large and disproportionate amount of hospital resources\
Long-stay ICU patients comprise **~5% of** ICU **patients** but **30% of** ICU **bed-days**.
* Are relatively under-researched

After 10 days, antecedent characteristics are more important than acute characteristics for outcome ([Iwashyna et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(16))).

## Post-ICU Effects

Need to recognise these are complex patients with multiple issues and have a high readmission rate - ICU discharge should be a planned affair.

Coordinating Discharge:

* Clinician to clinician handover
* Follow-up by ICU outreach team


Ongoing issues:

* D
	* Weakness
	* Pain
	* PTSD
