# Paediatric Considerations

:::caution
This covers principles of paediatric critical care for the adult intensivist. In general:

* Principles of adult intensive care can be safely extrapolated to children
* Involve a paediatrician early for consideration of nuances

:::column-margin
Paediatric anaesthetic considerations, including airway management, is covered in detail under @sec-paeds_anaes.
:::

Difference:

* Congenital anomalies are common
	* ~1% of children have a congenital anomaly
* Periodic breathing
	* Risk of apnoea
* Diaphragmatic reliance
	* Easily fatigued
* CO is HR dependent
	* Relatively fixed stroke volume
	* Unexplained, persistent tachycardia over 30 minutes to 4 hours is very concerning
	* Therapy that ↓ HR may precipitate profound shock
	* BP will commonly remain normal until shock is advanced


* Anticipate deterioration during intubation
* Suspect sepsis
* Suspect NAI
* Treat neonates for everything


* Sick enough for ICU referral demands a CXR
	* Mediastinal mass
	* Heart failure
	* Foreign body
	* Congenital abnormality


* 4/2/1 over-estimates fluid requirements
	* Give 50-70% of this in critically unwell


* Parental presence during resuscitation is generally hellpful

## Respiratory Disease

* SpO~2~:
	* Normal: 90-95%
	* Pulmonary HTN: >95%
	* Chronic lung disease: 88-92%
	* Single ventricle/chronic heart: 75-85%
* CO~2~:
	* Consider ventilator dead space
	* Targets as adults

### Stridor

Croup:

* Dexamethasone 0.6mg/kg
* Adrenaline 5mg nebuliser
* Intubation
	* Small ETT required
	* Gas induction in OT preferable


Epiglottitis:

* Softer stridor
* Unimmunised
* Drooling
	* Painful swallowing
* Require intubation


Bacterial tracheitis:

### Wheezing

Problems:

* Wheeze
	* Bronchiolitis
	* Asthma

* Inflammation vs. bronchospasm
	* Atelectasis
	* Dynamic hyperinflation



* May respond to salbutamol if <1 year of age, particularly if history of atopy
* NG feeding to 70%
* High flow oxygen 2L/kg
* Target SpO2 >90%

* Acute viral myocarditis
	* Not better with bronchiolitis treatment
	* Palpable liver
	* Deterioration with IV fluid bolus
* Pertussis
	* Apnoea common


## Cardiac Presentations

Heart Failure:

* Left to right shunts
* Hepatomegaly\
Sensitive and specific in small children for right heart failure.
* Murmurs
* Target SpO~2~ in low 90%s
	* Hyperoxia will ↓ PVR and ↑ left to right shunt


Severe cyanosis:

* Hypoxaemia non-responsive to supplemental oxygen
* No ↑ work of breathing
* "Black lungs" on CXR
	* Little pulmonary blood flow
* Need prostin
* Need atrial septostomy


Cardiogenic shock:

* Duct-dependent lesions
	* Rapid onset of poor perfusion
	* Absent femoral pulses
	* Floppy, acidotic baby
	* Intubation
	* Inotropes
	* Prostin infusion
	* Target SpO2 75-85%
	* Target palpable pulses and improved perfusion
	* Cover for sepsis


## Metabolic Presentations

Four broad presentations:

* Hypoglycaemia:
	* Primary energy failure
* HAGMA
	* Intoxication
* Acute liver failure
* Encephalopathy and seizures

Management:

* Rule out sepsis
* NBM
* Stop catabolism
* Dextrose infusion
* Call for help
