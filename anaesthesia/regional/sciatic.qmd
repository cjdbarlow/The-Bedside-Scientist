# Sciatic Nerve Block

Blockade provides anaesthesia to:

* Majority of lower leg (including motor)  
**Excluding** areas supplied by the saphenous nerve, i.e. **medial leg, ankle, and foot**.


## Indications

Can be used:

* Analgesia for
	* Knee surgery
* Anaesthesia for:
	* Foot and ankle surgery
	* Knee surgery  
	Requires concomitant femoral nerve block.

## Contraindications

* General contraindications:
	* Patient refusal
	* LA allergy
	* Local infection

## Anatomy

{{< include /includes/ll_neuro.qmd >}}


## Equipment

* Standard nerve block tray
* High-frequency linear probe or low-frequency curvilinear probe
* 10-15cm needle
* Local anaesthetic
	* 20-30ml of 0.75% ropivacaine

## Technique

Indication determines level to be blocked:

* Proximal  
Hip surgery.
* Mid-thigh/bifurcation  
Knee/foot/ankle surgery.


### Lateral Approach

* Position  
Can be:
	* Semi-prone  
	For all approaches.
	* Supine with hip and knee flexed  
	For mid-distal approaches.
	* Oblique  
	For mid-distal approaches.
* Place probe on posterior thigh
* Identify sciatic nerve
	* Hyperechoic
	* Large
	* Between gluteus maximus and adductor magnus
	* Posterior to femur
* Follow course of nerve to confirm nerve identify and the intended level of block
* Standard prep, drape, skin anaesthesia, etc
* Perform block:
	* Whilst scanning the posterior thigh, insert the needle IP through the lateral thigh
	* Insert the needle anterior to the probe, such that the needle is heading directly towards the lateral edge of the nerve  
	i.e. if the nerve is 5cm deep on ultrasound, insert the needle 5cm anterior to the probe position.
	* Aim to inject within the common epineurium of the sciatic nerve  
	Separate blocks of the tibial and common peroneal nerves can be performed if required.
	* Aspirate and inject 1-2ml of LA to confirm location  
	High pressure suggests intraneural injection - stop.
	* Inject remainder of LA


### Anterior Approach

The anterior approach is:

* Better for analgesia post TKR
* Not well suited for catheter insertion  
Deep, and traverses several muscles.


* Position patient supine
* Use a curvilinear (low frequency) probe
* Place probe **~8cm** from inguinal crease on anteromedial thigh
* Identify femoral vessels and femur
* Identify sciatic nerve at the medial edge of the femur
	* Lies between the planes of adductor magnus and hamstrings
	* Probe may need to be angled medially
* Perform block:  
OOP approach is typically easier than IP approach:
	* Identification of needle may be difficult
	* Walk needle off medial edge of femur
	* Aim to place needle adjacent to sciatic nerve in the plane between adductors and biceps femoris
	* Confirm needle position with:
		* Stimulator
		* Jiggling
		* Cautious aspiration and injection  
		Don't advance needle if injectate is not seen when OOP technique used.
	* Apirate and inject remainder of LA

	
## Complications

* General complications
	* Intravascular injection
	* LAST
	* Nerve injury
	* Infection
	* Failure
	* Allergy to LA
