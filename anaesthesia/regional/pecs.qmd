# Pectoralis I and II Blocks


> Blockade of the long thoracic or thoracodorsal nerves requires a [serratus anterior plane block](/regional/anaesthesia/serratus.md)

Pectoralis blocks are superficial plane blocks used to provide analgesia to the anterior chest wall by blockade of pectoral and intercostal nerves.

Pecs I block:

* Plane block between pectoral muscles
* Aims to block **median** and **lateral pectoral nerves**


## Indications

## Contraindications

## Anatomy

Layers of the chest wall:

* Skin
* Subcutaneous tissue
* Pectoralis major
* Pectoralis minor
* Serratus anterior\
Present more laterally.
* Ribs and intercostal muscles

## Equipment

* High frequency linear probe
* 50-100mm regional needle
* 0.4ml/kg of 0.25% levobupivacaine or 0.375% ropivacaine

## Technique

* Position supine
* For Pecs I:
	* Identify coracoid process on ultrasound in a sagittal plane
	* Rotate the probe in place to identify the **thoracoacromial artery**\
	Lies in target plane between pectoralis major and pectoralis minor. Identifying serratus anterior in the same view allows the Pecs II block to be performed with the same injection.
	* Advance needle from superomedial to inferolateral into the plane between **pectoralis major** and **minor**
	* Inject 0.2ml/kg of LA
* For Pecs II:
	* Place probe in mid-clavicular line and angle infero-laterally
	* Identify axillary artery and vein
	* Translate probe laterally until pectoralis minor and serratus anterior are identified
	* Advance needle from superomedial to inferolateral into the plane between **pectoralis minor** and **serratus anterior**
	* Inject 0.2ml/kg of LA
