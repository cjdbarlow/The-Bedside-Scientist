# Principles of Regional Anaesthesia


*This section covers aspects common to peripheral nerve blockade. [Complications](/anaesthesia/regional/principles.md) are covered elsewhere.*

This section is divided into:

* Requirements
* Procedural techniques
* Delivery mechanisms
* LA dosing

## Requirements

Requires:

* Informed consent
	* Nerve injury
	* Drug toxicity
	* Haemodynamic changes
	* Bleeding/bruising
	* Failure
* Assistance
* Sterile technique
* Coagulation assessment
* IV access
* Monitoring
* Ability to manage potential complications

### Block Time-Out {#timeout}

Prior to performing a regional block:

* Verify the **side** and **site** of proposed block with another clinician\
Requires:
	* Patient identification
	* Checking of the surgical consent
	* Identification of a surgical site mark
	* Discussion with the patient if possible
	* Placement of a mark close enough to the block site to be visible whilst performing the block
	* **Pausing *just*** prior to needle insertion to:
		* Verify presence of side and site mark
		* Verbally confirm site with the assistant

## Procedural Techniques

Can use:

* Landmark only
* Nerve stimulator
* Ultrasound


### Landmark

### Ultrasound

* Gold standard
* Associated with reduced rate of vascular injury compared to stimulator
	* Identify vessels on proposed needle path and choose approach to avoid them
* Approach:
	* Halt needle advancement prior to encountering nerve
	* Aim off
* **Tips for optimising success**:
	* Place digital pressure on the needle insertion site\
	Allows insertion site to be used as a fulcrum and torque the needle to drastically change direction after having penetrated a muscle plane.
	* Penetrate fascial planes away from nerves/vessels, then slide up within that plane
	* Injection inside the nerve *sheath* causes a rapid onset of surgical anaesthesia, but â†‘ the risk of nerve injury

### Stimulator

* Allows localisation of nerves via electrical stimulation
* Stimulate:
	* At 1mA until muscle contractions visible in that nere area
	* Reduce current to 0.3-0.5mA/0.1ms prior to injection
* Consider giving a 0.5ml saline injection (Raj test)\
Should be associated with a loss of motor response.

Troubleshooting:

* Battery charged
* Wires are connected
* ECG electrode has good electrical contact
* Ensure landmarks correct


## Delivery Mechanisms

Can use:

* Single-shot
* Catheter

### Single-Shot

### Catheter for Continuous Infusion

* Prepare skin carefully\
Ensure catheter is not contaminated by alcohol solutions (neurotoxic).
* Inject small bolus of LA prior to inserting catheter\
Hydrodissect space for catheter.
* Pass catheter 2-5cm past needle tip
* Remove needle\
Ensure catheter position does not change.
* Inject remainder of loading dose into catheter

Postoperative management:

* Unambiguous labeling of the giving set
	* Tubing colour should be unique to regional analgesia infusions
	* Infusion pumps should be unique to regional analgesia
* Regular monitoring of physiological parameters and pain
* Ideally daily review by the proceduralist or a trained delegate
* Continue LA delivery:
	* Constant infusion at 2-10ml/h
	* Background infusion of 2ml/h with 5ml Q30min boluses PRN
* May be left in for 3-5 days


Troubleshooting:

* Ensure catheter is positioned correctly/not dislodged
* Consider bolus (e.g. 10ml 0.2% ropivacaine) if only partial analgesia present


## Dosing


**Single-shot:**

|Factors|Lignocaine|Bupivacaine|Ropivacaine|
|--|--|
|**Concentration**|1-2%|0.25-0.5%|0.5-1%|
|**Dose**|< 4mg/kg|< 2mg/kg|< 3mg/kg|
|**Time to Onset**|5-15 minutes|10-25 minutes|10-25 minutes|
|**Duration**|2-5 hours|Up to 12 hours|Up to 12 hours|


**Continuous Infusion:**

||Bupivacaine|Ropivacaine|
|--|--|
|**Concentration**|0.125-0.25%|0.2%|
|**Maximum Dose Rate**|Up to 18.75mg/hr|Up to 28mg/hr|
