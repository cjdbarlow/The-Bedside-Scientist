# Erector Spinae Plane Block


Paraspinal fascial plane block, which:

* Involves injecting LA deep to the erector spinae muscle and superficial to the tip of the transverse process\
Distant from the spine, paravertebral space, pleura and vessels.
* Can be performed on anticoagulated patients


## Indications

> Particularly beneficial in patients where epidural or paravertebral blocks are contraindicated

Thoracic wall analgesia:

* â©¾3 Rib fractures


## Contraindications

## Anatomy

Landmarks:

* Identify spinous processes midline
* Translate paramedian to identify transverse process and ribs on ultrasound

Layers:

* Skin
* Subcutaneous tissue
* Trapezius\
Present in, absent
* Erector spinae muscle\
Block performed in plane between erector spinae and transverse processes.
* Transverse processes separated by muscles (Multifidus and Rotatores)\
* Ribs and intercostal muscles\
* Paravertebral space
* Pleura



## Equipment

* High frequency linear transducer
* Needle and catheter kit
	* 18G Tuohy needle
	* 18G Pajunk catheter-over-needle kit
* Local

## Technique

Position:

* Sitting
* Lateral decubitus


Probe:

* Place in parasaggital orientation ~3cm lateral to the spinous process
* Identify the transverse processes\
Flat, squared off "tombstone" shadows. Distinguished from the ribs which are:
	* More lateral
	* Deeper
	* Rounded off
	* Separated by hyperechoic pleural line


Needle:

* Insert IP, cranial to caudal
* Contact the bony shadow of the TP with the tip **deep to the fascial plane** of the erector spinae\
Injection of 0.5-1ml of saline will demonstrate linear fluid spread separating erector spinae from the TP in **both** cranial and caudal directions.
* Place catheter
* Confirm correct catheter position by bolusing solution down needle sheath


Pump:

* Multiple potential infusion regimens
* Intermittent boluses\
15ml 0.2% ropivacaine Q3H, with 5ml bolus Q1H.
* Continuous infusion 
10ml/hr 0.125% bupivacaine.
