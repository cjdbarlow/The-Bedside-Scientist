# Axillary Plexus Block


Blockade of the brachial plexus in the axilla. This block:

* Avoids the risk of pneumothorax associated with more proximal blocks
* Gives better coverage of the ulnar artery
* Traditionally was associated with poor blockade of the musculocutaneous nerve when performed with a landmark technique, but this is essentially moot when performed with ultrasound
* Allows individual targeting of the four major nerves of the brachial plexus
	* Radial nerve
	* Median nerve
	* Ulnar nerve
	* Musculocutaneous nerve

## Indications

* Anaesthesia and analgesia for:
	* Distal upper arm
	* Forearm A-V fistula.
	* Wrist and Hand\
	e.g. carpal ORIF, carpectomy, metacarpal ORIF, proximal phalanx ORIF, fasciectomy, dupuytren's contracture.
* Sympathicolysis
* Pain syndromes

## Contraindications

## Anatomy

{{< include /includes/ul_neuro.qmd >}}

## Equipment

* 50-100mm 21G needle
* Local anaesthetic\
20-30ml of:
	* 1.5-2% lignocaine with 1:200,000 adrenaline
	* 0.75-1% ropivacaine\
	0.2-0.375% ropivacaine appropriate for postoperative analgesia only, or if early neurological assessment required.
	* 1% lignocaine with 0.5% ropivacaine
* High or intermediate frequency linear transducer


## Technique

* Position
	* Supine
	* Head turned to contralateral side
	* Position ipsilateral arm above head\
	i.e. Externally rotated with 90Â° of abduction and elbow flexion.

### Ultrasound Guided Approaches

* Place US probe
	* Perpendicular to skin
	* In short axis along the line of pectoralis major
* Identify axillary artery\
Nerves are located *mostly* around the artery:
	* Median is superoanteriorly
	* Ulnar inferoposteriorly
	* Radial posteriorly
	* Musculocutaneous is located either:
		* Commonly in a facial plane between biceps brachii and coracobrachialis
		* Within coracobrachialis
* Trace nerves to elbow and return
* Place 5ml of LA around each nerve\
Target deeper nerves first.
