# Supraclavicular Block


*The **spinal** block **of the arm**.*

Blockade provides excellent analgesia to the arm, though may miss much of the shoulder. Phrenic nerve may still be anaesthetised via proximal spread.

## Indications

* Analgesia for arm and hand surgery  
In particular:
	* Mid-distal humerus fracture
	* Major elbow surgery
	* Major forearm/wrist surgery  
	Axillary block also effective if surgery is in the ulnar nerve distribution.


## Contraindications

Absolute:

* Contralateral recurrent laryngeal or phrenic nerve injury
* Contralateral pneumonectomy/pneumothorax

Relative:

* Reduced respiratory reserve

## Anatomy

{% include "/stubs/ul-neuro.md" %}

## Equipment

* 50-100mm 22-24G needle
* Local anaesthetic  
20-30ml of:
	* 1-2% lignocaine
	* 0.75-1% ropivacaine  
	0.2-0.5% ropivacaine sufficient for post-operative analgesia. Higher concentrations required for surgical anaesthesia.
	* 1% lignocaine with 0.5% ropivacaine  
* High to intermediate frequency linear transducer

## Technique

* Position semirecumbent
	* Head rotated to contralateral side
* Place probe parasagitally in supraclavicular fossa
* **Identify brachial plexus**  
In the "corner pocket":
	* Superoanterior to SCA  
	Pleura and 1st rib should be identifiable deep to SCA.
	* Between scalenus anterior and scalenus medius
	* Deep to omohyoid
* Note presence of dorsal scapular artery superficial to brachial plexus
Use colour doppler over planned needle trajectory to minimise risk of vascular injury.
* Can use IP or OOP technique  
Ensure needle tip is placed superficial to the 1st rib.


## Complications

Specific complications include:

* PTHx/HTx
* Phrenic nerve block
* Horners Syndrome
* SCA injury
