# Caudal Epidural Block


Injection of LA into the epidural space:

* Via the sacral hiatus
* Through the sacro-coccygeal ligament
* Below the termination of the cord

## Indications

Intra- and post-operative analgesia up to the umbilicus.


## Contraindications

*This covers contraindications specific to caudal epidural anesthesia. General contraindications to neuraxial techniques are covered under [principles of neuraxial anaesthesia](/anaesthesia/regional/principles/principles-neuraxial.md).


Relative:

* Abnormal sacral anatomy\
Pigmentation, dimples, and hair may be associated with spina bifida or a tethered cord - normal neuroanatomy should be confirmed prior.
* Significance of motor weakness\
Often not done once mobilising or too big for a pram/stroller.

## Anatomy

Predominantly a landmark technique. Identify:

* Coccyx\
Identifies midline.
* Posterior sacroiliac joints
* Sacral cornuae\
Tubercles of the inferior articular processes.
	* Palpate cranial-caudal to identify the location of the ligament\
	This should be located midline, at the point forming an **equilateral triangle with each SI joint**.

## Equipment

* Sterile preparation
* Syringe
* Needle
	* 25G to 23G needle\
	Finer needles associated with IV or SAH injection.
* Cannula\
Good alternative to needle.
	* Reduced incidence of dural puncture
	* Less likely to migrate during injection
	* 20G appropriate for most children
	* 22G if <8kg
	* 24G in premature babies


Drug prepration::

* Local anaesthetic
	* 0.25% levobupivacaine
	* 0.2% ropivacaine\
	Less motor block than levobupivacaine.
* Additives
	* Clonidine 1.5Î¼g/ml\
	Prolongs caudal analgesia.
* Total injectate volume determines block height:
	* Sacral: 0.5ml/kg
	* Lower thoracic: 1ml/kg\
	Common dose used.
	* Upper thoracic: 1.25ml/kg\
	May have significant cephalad spread.

## Technique


### Preparation

* Obtain IV access
* Apply ECG monitoring
* Identify site

### Procedure

* Apply sterile preparation
* Identify sacral hiatus
* Cannulate sacral hiatus
	* Bevel facing posteriorly
	* Pop or loss of resistance should be felt as needle passes through sacrococcygeal membrane
	* Do not advance needle more than **2-3mm** in space
* Leave open to air to rule-out inadvertant IV or intrathecal placement
With a cannula, this time can be used to draw up solution.
* Perform aspiration test
* Slowly inject selected dose

### Post-Procedure

* Ensure parents know to watch & return if:
	* Signs of weakness
	* Urinary retention
	* Local infection


## Complications

* Failure\
~10%.
* Urinary retention
* Motor block\
Common and significant in older children.
* Inadvertent dural puncture
* Systemic LA toxicity
