# Spinal Anaesthesia


Spinal anaesthesia is:

* Performed by injecting local anaesthetic into the CSF\
Typically below where the cord ends (L2).
	* Autonomic and pain fibres are blocked first\
	Vasodilation and hypotension correspond with block.
	* Motor fibres are blocked last\
	Motor fibres also recover first.
* Generally easy to perform\
* Useful for surgery below the umbilicus
* Cheap


## Indications

Relative:

* Patient factors
	* Difficult airway\
	Airway patency is maintained.
	* Respiratory disease\
	Less respiratory impairment than GA.
	* Frailty and systemic disease\
	Spinal anaesthesia tends to be less physiologically disruptive.
* Surgical factors
	* Sub-umbilical surgery
	* Muscle relaxation\
	Good operating conditions provided.
	* Reduced blood loss


## Contraindications

*This covers contraindications specific to spinal anesthesia. General contraindications to neuraxial techniques are covered under [principles of neuraxial anaesthesia](/anaesthesia/regional/principles/principles-neuraxial.md).*

* Operative duration\
	Surgery expected to last >2 hours will usually require a different technique.


* C
	* Volume and haemodynamic state
* D
	* Anxiety levels
* E
	* Back anatomy
	* Presence of local infection

## Preparation

* Alert the patient that spinal anaesthesia:
	* Removes pain but some sensation may remain\
	This will be weird or uncomfortable but shouldn't be painful
	* Causes motor weakness
* Standard ANZCA monitoring\
Regular (e.g. 1 minutely) BP after spinal injection.
* 18G or greater IVC
* Vasopressor available\
Consider infusion if it is necessary to defend SBP.
* LP equipment
* Local anaesthetic\

### Factors Affecting Block Spread

> With the exception of baricity and patient position, the influence of most of these factors is small and unpredictable

* **Baricity**\
Hyperbaric solutions behave more predictably due to the effect of gravity.
* Patient **position**\
Block height can be altered for up to 20 minutes post injection.
* Concentration and volume of LA
	* Volume determines extent of block
	* Dose (mg) determines block density\
	Therefore the same dose administered in a lower volume (i.e. higher concentration) causes a denser block.
* Level of injection\
Blocks achieve a denser block close to the level of injection.
* Speed of injection\
Slower injections produce more predictable spread.
* Intraabdominal pressure\
Affects epidural vein volume, which in turn affects CSF volume.

### Dosing

Classically bupivacaine is used:
	* Typically lasts **2-2.5 hours**
	* Can be either:
		* Hyperbaric/heavy bupivacaine\
		Mixed with 8% dextrose. Heavy bupivacaine:
			* Dosing of heavy bupivacaine
				* Adults: 2-4ml (10-20mg)
				* <5kg: 0.4-0.5mg/kg
				* 5-15kg: 0.3-0.4mg/kg
				* 15-40: 0.25-0.3mg/kg
		* Plain bupivacaine\
		Mixed with saline online. Plain bupivacaine:
			* Tends to rise slightly
			* Cannot be adjusted
			* Dosing
				* Adults: 2-3.5ml 0.5% plain bupivacaine
		



Additives:

* 8% dextrose\
Forms hyperbaric "heavy" bupivacaine, which:
	* Allows block height and spread to be adjusted by position
	* Can be adjusted by adjusting patient position\
	For a block at L3/4:
		* Sitting patients will tend to achieve an upper block height on T7-T10\
		Allows a dense saddle block to be achieved with relatively small volumees.
		* Supine patients will tend to achieve an upper block of T4-T7
* Opioid\
Opioid may be added to prolong the duration of analgesia and reduce the dose of LA required, at the risk of respiratory depression. Dosing:
	* Fentanyl 10-25ug\
	Lasts 1-4 hours.
	* Morphine 100-300ug\
	Lasts 8-24 hours.

## Induction

*Performance of lumbar puncture is covered [here](/procedures/regional/lp.md).*

### Assessing Block

* By temperature\
Using ice, relative to a reference standard (e.g. the forehead). Temperature sensation will be lost **1-2 dermatomal levels above pain**, which is useful for determining adequate surgical anesthesia.
* By pain\
Assess response to pain (e.g. pinching with toothed forceps) prior to commence operation. Pain sensation is lost **1-2 dermatomal levels above touch**.
* By touch
* By motor function\
Objective motor weakness, using the **Bromage score**:
	* 0: No motor block
	* 1: Inability to raise extended leg; able to move knees and feet
	* 2: Inability to raise extended leg or knee; able to move feet
	* 3: Complete motor block


### Troubleshooting Block

* Block too low\
	* With a hyperbaric solution\
	Tilt the patient head down.
	* With a plan solution\
	Turn the patient supine and then prone again.
* Block too high


## Intraoperative

## Postoperative


## Complications

Can result either from:

* Dural puncture
	* Post Dural Puncture Headache
* Spinal anaesthesia
	* Bradycardia\
	Due to blockade of cardioaccelerator fibres.
		* If symptomatic, hypotensive, or excessively bradycardic\
		Consider atropine or glycopyrrolate.
	* Hypotension\
	Generally due to drop in SVR.
		* Vasopressors\
	* [High/Total Spinal](/anaesthesia/crisis/totalspinal.md)
