# Complications of Regional Anaesthesia

Complications may include:

* LAST
* Vascular injury
* Infection
* Nerve Injury
* Block-specific complications  
Covered in detail under specific blocks; examples include phrenic nerve block after performing a supraclavicular brachial pleuxus block.


## Local Anaesthetic Systemic Toxicity

LAST:

* Occurs in ~1/1,000-1/10,000 regional techniques
	* Cardiac arrest in ~1/25,000
* Risk is reduced by:
	* Aspirating repeatedly during injection
	* Inject LA in discrete boluses
	* Ensure good spread of LA on ultrasound
	* Inject slowly

## Vascular injury

Vascular injury may lead to haematoma and secondary injury due to mass effect. Prevention involves:

* Avoiding vascular injury:
	* Identify vessels prior to injection
	* Choose a needle path that minimises peri-vascular approach
	* Compress veins during needle passage (after they have been identified)
* **Managing anticoagulants**  
Peripheral nerve blocks are low risk for serious bleeding. *In general* (and **in absence of other risk factors**; such as age, renal/hepatic disease, history of major bleeding):
	* Aspirin and NSAIDs do not need to be discontinued  
	* P2Y12 inhibits do not need to be discontinued  
	Includes clopidogrel, ticagrelor, prasugrel.
	* Warfarin may safely be continued if INR < 3.0  
	Cessation should be discussed with treating team.
	* UFH should be ceased at least 4 hours before the procedure, and restarted 2 hours after
	* Prophylactic-dose LMWH should be last given at least 12 hours prior
	* Therapeutic-dose LMWH should be last given at least 24 hours prior
	* NOACs may be safely continued  
	Cessation should be discussed with the treating team, and at least 2 drug half-lifes should occur between cessation and intervention.


## Infection

* Risk is increased with use of continuous catheters versus single-shot techniques  
Catheters should be placed under strict asepsis.

## Nerve injury

*This section describes nerve injuries relating to peripheral nerve blocks. Management of central neuraxial injuries are covered elsewhere.*

Nerve injury related to anaesthesia is:

* Defined as a:
	* New onset of pain, weakness, numbness, or abnormal sensation
	* Lasting beyond the usual duration of the specified block
* Rare  
~2-4/10,000 blocks.
* Risk factors
	* Intraneural injection  
	Injection of LA should be performed outside of the connective tissue sheath of the nerve, in the plane of cleavage between epineurium and the extraneural connective tissue layers.
		* Should be a low-pressure, hydrodissection of the space
		* Intraneural injection may be identified as nerve expansion under ultrasound
* Techniques to avoid nerve injury:
	* Avoid injecting if paresthesiae present
	* Use atraumatic needle
	* Notably not reduced with ultrasound guidance


Deficits:
	* Predominantly sensory  
	Paraesthesias.
	* Typically resolve in less than a month:
		* 92% resolve in 1 month
		* 96% in 3 months
		* > 99% in 6 months



### Management of Nerve Injury

Review:

* Anaesthetic record
* Surgical record
* Drug chart
* Observations


Evaluate deficit  
* Mild/resolving symptoms or persistent sensory deficit
	* Reassure and review in 4 weeks  
	If ongoing persistent symptoms:
		* Neurology referral
		* Consider:
			* MRI
			* Nerve conduction studies
			* Electromyography
* Complete/progressive deficit or **any motor deficit**
	* Immediate neurological referral
	* Consider:
		* Nerve conduction studies
		* Electromyography
		* Further imaging  
		Expedite if potential requirement for urgent decompression.
	* Consider:
		* Surgical causes
		* Need for surgical intervention
