# Transversus Abdominis Plane Block 


The TAP block is a regional technique to provide analgesia to the anterior abdominal wall, between the mid-clavicular lines. There are three approaches:

* Posterior approach\
Performed laterally above the iliac crest, and provides analgesia below the umbilicus.
* Subcostal approach\
Performed under the costal margin, lateral to the rectus, and provides periumbilical analgesia.
* Oblique subcostal approach\
Multiple injections along the oblique subcostal line, and provides analgesia to upper abdominal incisions.

## Indications

* Abdominal surgery where epidural would be excessive or contraindicated

## Anatomy

* The TAP lies between:
	* Internal oblique and transversus abdominus in the inferior and lateral areas of the abdominal wall
	* Rectus abdominus and transversus abdominus in the subcostal abdominal wall
* The TAP contains the thoracolumbar nerves (T6-L1) which innervate the abdominal wall
* Thoracolumbar nerves consist of intercostal, subcostal, iliohypogastric, and ilioinguinal nerves
* All travel beneath the rectus and run for a variable distance through the TAP before penetrating the rectus sheath\
This may occur quite laterally, so **medial blocks may miss the nerve** if it has already penetrated the internal oblique muscle.

## Equipment

* Ultrasound machine, gel, probe cover\
High or low frequency probe acceptable.
* Needle and catheter kit\
e.g. 18G Touhy or 21G 100mm ultrasound needle.
* Local anaesthetic\
Typically 3mg/kg ropivacine (up to 200mg) diluted with N/S to 40ml (20ml each side)
* Sterile equipment


## Technique

* Prepare equipment
* Identify the rectus abdominus and transversus abdominus muscle at the costal margin

* Scan inferiorly to identify the TAP at the level of the surgical incision
* Place the needle medial to the probe (close to midline), and travel inferolaterally towards the iliac crest into the TAP\

* Hydrodisect the TAP with 1-2ml of LA solution to confirm correct placement
* Wound catheters may also be placed\
	* Use epidural or nerve block catheters
	* Catheters may be left up to **5 days**
	* Catheters may be managed as:
		* Regular boluses (e.g. 20ml of LA solution) Q6H
		* Continuous infusion (e.g. 5ml/hr ropivacaine 0.2%)
