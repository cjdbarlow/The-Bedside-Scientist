# Principles of Ear, Nose, and Throat Surgery


>* ENT surgery has the anaesthetist and surgeon sharing the airway\
>Anaesthetic management has to adapt to surgical concerns.
>* 40% of difficult airway cases in NAP4 were ENT

General principles for anaesthesia for ENT surgery include:

* Appreciating the **shared** and **remote airway**:
	* Limited access
	* Casual surgical vandalism
		* Dislodgement
		* Eyes
		* Lips
		* Teeth
* Use of **throat packs**
* Good **analgesia** plan\
Surgery may often be highly stimulating intraoperatively, but post-operative pain may be minimal.
	* High dose fentanyl for major ENT surgery
	* Remifentanil for procedures with low post-operative pain\
	0.5-1μg/kg load, and infusion at 0.1-0.3μg/kg/min.
* **Smooth emergence**\
Straining or coughing during emergence can ↑ bleeding, disrupt repairs, or dislodge grafts.
	* Deep extubation if appropriate
	* Exchange to LMA
	* Remifentanil at 0.1μg/kg/min until extubation
* Careful **preoperative assessment**
	* History
		* Vocal changes\
		Suggests a glottic lesion.
		* Stridor\
		Highly significant.
		* Dyspnoea\
		Supine dyspnoea concerning for >50% laryngeal obstruction.
		* Pain
			* Ear\
			Suggests supraglottic.
		* Dysphagia\
		Suggests ↑ size.
	* Examination
	* Investigations
		* Nasoendoscopy
		* CXR
		* CT/MRI
		* Ultrasound
		* ABG
		* LFTs

## Anaesthetic Techniques

Classify into:

* **Tube**
	* ETT
	* MLT
	* Laser-resistant
	* Awake tracheostomy\
	Consider for:
		* Critical upper airway obstruction\
		Consider under LA.
		* Predicted difficult intubation
		* Failed intubation
		* Predicted difficult extubation
		* Failed extubation
* **Tubeless**\
	* HFNO\
		* Fire risk
		* Avoid in:
			* Hypertensive patients
			* Obese patients
			* Unwell patients\
			Hypercapnoea will occur and may be problematic in long cases.
		* Techniques:
			* Apnoeic\
			* Spontaneously ventilating\
				* Propofol infusion and HFNO
				* Often technically difficult to achieve
	* [Jet ventilation](/anaesthesia/ent/jet-vent.md)
		* Supraglottic\
			* Risk of missing larynx and hypoxia
		* Infraglottic\
			* ↑ risk of barotrauma
			* Reduced cord movement
		* Transtracheal
* **Intermittent ventilation**\
e.g. LMA, oxygenate, remove LMA, procedure, desaturate, replace LMA, repeat...


## Laryngeal Surgery

Anaesthesia for laryngeal lesions requires **understanding the pathology**, as this determines:

* Surgical approach and technique\
This dictates the:
	* Potential options for **anaesthetic** and **airway management**\
	* Surgical requirements
		* Laser\
		See [laser safety](/anaesthesia/considerations/laser-safety.md).
		* Head motion/position
		* Use of **nerve monitoring**\
		Requires avoidance of muscle relaxation.
		* Airway access\
		Often airway is inaccessible during surgery.
* Likelihood of difficult airway\
Airway compromise is common in these patients.


### Glottic Lesions

* Location
	* Anterior\
	Usually amenable to **MLT**/ETT if tracheal inspection not required.
	* Posterior\
	Not amenable to ETT, requires either **jet** or **apnoeic** (tubeless) oxygenation.
* Type of pathology
	* Papilloma
		* Laser
		* Usually requires surgeon to inspect the entire bronchial tree
* Surgical technique
* State of airway on completion of surgery\
Often worse:
	* Blood
	* Oedema


### Subglottic Lesion

* Location
	* Amenability to **tracheostomy**
	* Extent of lesion
* Airway usually improved on completion of surgery


### Supraglottic Lesion

* Often straightforward larynx but view impeded by pathology\
Often need some **alternative device**:
	* VL
	* FOI
	* Awake tracheostomy
* Imaging
* Nasoendoscopy
* Method of surgical treatment
* State of airway on completion of surgery


### Nasal Surgery

Topical vasoconstrictors:

* May precipitate profound hypertension\
Beware **ischaemic heart disease**.
	* Best managed with short-acting vasodilators
	* Consider short acting β-blockers (e.g. esmolol) in patients already β-blockaded
* Cocaine\
Less commonly used. Up to 2mg/kg.
* Adrenaline\
Commonly used. Dose will depend on current haemodynamics.


Bloodless surgical field:

* Particularly important for nasal surgery as this allows easier identification of anatomy and expedites the procedure
* Aim:
	* 5-10° head up
	* Avoid hypercarbia
	* Hypotensive anaesthesia\
	Combination of lower SBP and HR ~60.
		* Remifentanil TCI 3-4ng/mL usually excellent option for all of the above
		* Consider adding esmolol, hydralazine, clonidine if unable to achieve this despite higher remifentanil use


Nasal obstruction:

* May be difficult o mask ventilate with a closed mouth in this patient population due to the nature of the surgery\
OPA is helpful.


Airway:

* Restricted access
* Decide between oral RAE or flexible LMA depending on aspiration risk and comfort level with limited access
* A well-fitting LMA will pool blood above and offer good protection to the airway
	* Leak can be managed with switching to an alternate size or packing the mouth with a throat pack\
	Leak will cause bubbles in the surgical field and be disruptive.


Analgesia:

* Usually minimal analgesia requirements post-procedure

### Ear Surgery

* Avoidance of nitrous\
Usually contraindicated to prevent distension of the middle ear, but may (at times) be requested by the ENT surgeon.
