Sedation outside the operating theatre is commonly required for:

	* Outpatient usually appropriate for ASA I-II
	* Infants under 1 year of age are particularly sensitive  
	Usually not appropriate for outpatient sedation.

	* Airway abnormalities
	* Aspiration risk
		* Fasting status
		* Bowel obstruction
* B
	* Respiratory failure
	* Active respiratory infection
* C
	* Cardiac failure
* D

	* High anxiety
		* Sedation usually not appropriate for an uncooperative child
		* Forced restraint is not helpful
