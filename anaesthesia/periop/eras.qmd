# Enhanced Recovery After Surgery


> * ERAS describes a bundle of interventions designed to improve perioperative care through standardisation and protocolisation  
>May reduce:
>	* LOS by 30-50%
>	* Complications by 10-20%
> * Specific interventions are centre and surgery dependent  
> Critics argue lack of RCTs and this variability â†“ strength of evidence.
> * Much of ERAS has been subsumed by **good perioperative care** and it can be difficult to distinguish ERAS pathways from normal management

ERAS describes a **bundle of care** designed to **attenuate** the **perioperative surgical response**, facilitate **return to premorbid function**, and **reduce complications**.


## Elements of ERAS

> Not all appropriate for all operations

Preoperative:

* Assessment
	* Shared decision making
	* Pre-operative counselling
* Optimisation
	* Pre-existing comorbidities
	* Anaemia
	* Smoking cessation
	* Alcohol cessation
	* Nutrition
		* Pre-operative carbohydrate loading
		* Avoid prolonged fasting
		* Avoid bowel preparation


Intraoperative:

* Laparoscopic surgery
* Minimise:
	* Chest drains
	* NGT
* Goal-directed fluid therapy
* Opioid-sparing analgesia
	* Paracetamol
	* NSAIDs
	* Tramadol
	* Regional
	* Epidural  
	Controversial due to impaired mobility.


Postoperative:

* Early mobilisation
* Nutrition
	* Early nutritional support
	* Early hydration
* VTE prophylaxis
* Antimicrobial prophylaxis


### ERAS+

Recent addition designed to prevent post-operative pulmonary complications. The mnemonic is ICOUGH:

* Incentive Spirometry
* Cough/deep breathing
* Oral care
* Understanding (patient education)
* (Get) out of bed
* Head of bed elevation


## Establishing ERAS Pathways

Involves:

* Consultation and need assessment
	* Benefits
	* Costs
	* Regulatory authority involvement
	* Review local hospitals with similar services and their guidelines
	* Review specialty hospitals for advice and review
	* Review college guidelines
* Plan and formulation
	* Set up MDT group to consider implementation and appropriate scope of practice
	* Develop local policy
	* Consider requirement for:
		* Staff training
		* Facilities required
	* Safety concerns
* Implementation
	* Slow rollout
* Review
	* Ongoing formal review and audit of effectiveness, safety, and cost
