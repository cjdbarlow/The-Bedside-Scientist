# Perioperative Neurocognitive Disorders


Umbrella term encompassing:

* **Post-Operative Delirium**\
Delirium occurring within 1 week post-procedure, and where other causes of delirium have been excluded.
* **Delayed Neurocognitive Recovery**\
Cognitive dysfunction occurring after surgery and up until 30 days post-operatively.
* **Post-Operative Cognitive Dysfunction**\
Cognitive dysfunction persisting after 30 days post-operatively. Graded based on extent of cognitive deficit into:
	* Mild
	* Major

## Risk Factors

**Predisposing factors**:

* â†‘ age
* Low premorbid IQ
* Lower education level
* Perioperative covert stroke
* Hearing or visual impairment
* Comorbidities
	* CVD
	* IHD
	* PVD
	* DM
	* Anaemia
	* PD
	* Depression and anxiety disorders
* Poor functional state
* Polypharmacy
* Use of psychotropic medications
	* Benzodiazepines
	* Anticholinergics
	* Antihistamines
	* Antipsychotics


**Precipitating factors**L
* Procedural
	* Hip fracture surgery
	* Aortic surgery
	* Prolonged surgery
* Physiological
	* Hypoxia
	* Hypercarbia
	* AKI
	* Prolonged fasting
	* Infection
	* Hypothermia
	* Electrolyte abnormalities
* Other
	* Alcohol
	* Sleep deprivation
	* IDC
	* Poor nutrition
	* Urinary retention


## Management

**Preoperative:**
* Assess risk
* Consider geriatric referral\
Associated with reduced incidence of POCD.


**Intraoperative:**
* Consider propofol TIVA
* Consider light sedation over deep sedation
* No evidence for benefit of neuraxial over GA
* Consider BIS target 40-60 for GA
* Avoid intraoperative hypotension


**Postoperative:**
* Non-pharmacological
	* Orientation
	* Early mobilisation
	* Non-pharmacological approaches
	* Prevention of sleep deprivation
	* Hearing aids and glasses
* Pharmacological
	* Antipsychotics\
	Minimise use as they may worsen delirium.
