# Laryngospasm

:::crisis
This is an **anaesthetic crisis**. Priority is to:

* **Break laryngospasm**
* **Maintain oxygenation**
:::

Involuntary contraction of the laryngeal muscles, resulting in closing of the vocal cords and glottic occlusion.


## Emergency Management

Immediately:

* Cease painful stimulation
* Prepare for intubation\
Delegate person to assemble drugs and airway equipment.

* Provide 100% oxygen
* Remove airway devices 
In mild laryngospasm (without total obstruction) it may be reasonable to attempt to break laryngospasm with the LMA in situ.
* Provide CPAP 30cmH~2~O\
This aims to stent open the airway.
	* Typically via face mask\
	Ensure optimal position, consider use of airway adjuncts.
	* Deliver low tidal volume ventilation if able via short, sharp squeezes on the bag\
	**Forced inflation will worsen obstruction if there is complete glottic occlusion**.
* Suction airway
* Consider applying painful pressure bilaterally on Larson's point, which *may* break laryngospasm\
Between mastoid process and posterior edge of mandible, applying pressure anteriorly and medially.\

Then:

* If SpO~2~ >92%, or if desaturation is expected to occur rapidly (obese, children)\
Deepen anaesthesia or relax the patient:
	* Suxamethonium 0.5mg/kg
	* Propofol ~20% of induction dose\
	Effective in ~80% of cases.
		* Deepens anaesthesia
		* Suppresses reflexes
	* Overpressure sevoflurane\
	If airway patent enough to ventilate.


* If SpO~2~ <92%\
Procede directly to intubation:
	* Suxamethonium 1-2mg/kg\
	IM is appropriate if an IV route is not available.

### Controversial Treatments

Lignocaine has been described to reduce coughing and laryngospasm:

* Evidence is not conclusive
* May â†“ incidence of laryngospasm in at-risk groups
* Not included in many emergency algorithims as its use may delay definitive therapy

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Laryngospasm is common (~9 per 1000 anaesthetics) and is associated with:

* Light anesthesia\
On induction and emergence.
* **Children**\
Double risk relative to adults (~18/1000 cases), greatest in preschool age groups.
* Airway contamination and stimulation:
	* ENT surgery\
	~20/1000 cases.
	* Oral secretions\
	Worse with recent URTI.
	* Blood
	* Foreign body
	* Aspiration/regurgitaiton/reflux
	* Near drowning


## Pathophysiology

Airway protection is a function of the larynx. The protective nature of the larygneal closure reflex is exaggerated and prolonged in laryngospasm.

Mechanics of laryngospasm can be divided into:

* Inspiratory stridor\
Occurs passively due to reduced aductor muscle tone.
* Expiratory stridor\
Due to active adduction of the cords.
* Ball-Valve obstruction\
Due to closure of the true cords, the false cords, and the supraglottic tissues.
	* In this mechanism, **positive pressure may worsen obstruction** as distension of the pyriform fossae press the aryepiglottic folds more firmly against each other
	* Jaw thrust is more effective in correcting obstruction via this mechanism (though paralysis is still often required)


## Clinical Manifestations

Laryngospasm should be suspected whenever there is airway obstruction with potential supraglottic cause.

Laryngospasm presents with:

* Stridor\
If airway is not completely occluded.
* Respiratory distress
	* Tachypnoea
	* Chest retraction\
	Due to very negative inspiratory airway pressures.
* Hypoxia\
May occur due to:
	* Impaired ventilation
	* Negative pressure pulmonary oedema
* Bradycardia and arrrest\
Secondary to hypoxia.


### History

### Examination

## Diagnostic Approach and DDx

## Investigations

## Management

### Post-Emergency Management

Once laryngospasm is broken:

* Consider deflating the stomach with an OGT prior to extubation
* Ensure deep anaesthesia for duration of muscle relaxation
* Ensure extubation only when the patient is fully awake\
Prior to extubation, perform an **artificial cough**:
	* Single lung inflation with 100% O~2~ prior to extubation
		* Delays desaturation
		* Ensures positive pressure in the trachea, which should result in forceful expiration clearing debris from laryngeal inlet

## Complications and Prognosis

Laryngospasm will break with **severe hypoxia**, but this may only occur after:

* Bradycardia and arrest, and death
* Aspiration
* Pulmonary oedema\
Negative pressure pulmonary oedema secondary to inspiratory efforts against a closed glottis.
