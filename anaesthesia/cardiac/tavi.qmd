Transarterial/endoluminal insertion of a prosthetic aortic valve. Anaesthetic strategies include:

* Sedation
	* Arterial line required
	* CVC or pacing wire may be requried
* GA

## Considerations

* C
	* Severity  
	Stenosis will worsen as sheath is positioned across the aortic valve. If AVA is already very low, then acute LV failure may occur.
	* Pacing wire  
	Potential for LBBB to occur during valve placement secondary to AV nodal damage. Consider pacing wire insertion in patients who are:
		* Extremely unwell
		* Have a prexisting RBBB


## Preparation

## Induction

## Intraoperative

### Surgical Stages

* Cannulation of femoral vessel
* Placement of sheath through the aortic valve
* Balloon dilation of aortic valve
* Removal of large femoral sheath

## Postoperative
