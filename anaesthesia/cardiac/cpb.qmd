# Cardiopulmonary Bypass


*This provides a broad overview of the process of CPB and the roles of the anaesthetist, surgeon, and perfusionist. Methods of [myocardial preservation](/anaesthesia/cardiac/myocardial-preservation.md) are covered elsewhere.*

Use of an external pump and oxygenator to generate pulseless blood flow and facilitate gas exchange. CPB involves:

* Cannulation may be central or peripheral
	* Central  
	Right atrium access and aortic return.
	* Peripheral  
	Typically femoral-femoral.
* Pump
	* Roller-head
	* Centrifugal  
	Less trauma to blood.
* Cardioplegic solution  
Hyperkalaemic solutions to induce asystole; reducing oxygen consumption and myocardial metabolic rate.
* Cooling  
Typically cooled to < 34°C to reduce oxygen consumption.
* Anticoagulation  
Systemic anticoagulation with heparin to prevent clotting of the bypass circuit.
	* Use of a pump requires at least partial anticoagulation  
	ACT > 180.
	* Use of an oxygenator requires full heparinisation  
	ACT > 480.


## Prior to CPB

Anaesthetist:

* Ensure both a central and peripheral temperature monitor are in situ if deep hypothermic arrest is going to be performed
* Prior to sternotomy, ensure:
	* Blood pressure is well controlled  
	Reduces the chance of significant haemorrhage from vascular damage.
	* Cease ventilation prior to sternotomy
* Measure baseline ACT  
Normal is 90-130.
* Commence TXA infusion  
	* Some evidence demonstrating reduced fibrinolysis, blood loss, ICC output, reoperation, and transfusion requirement
	* Many different protocols with wide variability in dosing  
	One protocol: 1g bolus then 6.5mg/kg/hr.
* Complete pre-bypass checklist:

**HAD2SAVE**:
	* Heparin given  
	Confirm administration by verifying back-bleeding from heparin delivery line.
	* ACT ⩾480  
	Threshold varies between centres.
		* Take sample from arterial line, or failing that PA distal on a PAC
	* Drugs  
		* Consider additional analgesia
		* Anaesthesia plan
		* Consider relaxant  
		Prevent shivering if cooling.
		* Vaporiser off
	* Drips off
	* Swan
		* Drugs not being infused down RV port during CPB  
		Will not be given during bypass, resulting in a bolus of these drugs into the systemic circulation when coming off CPB.
	* Alarms  
	Disable alarms.
	* Ventilator
		* Swap onto bag and open APL valve
		* Disable alarms
	* Emboli  
	Check arterial cannula for bubbles.


Perfusionist:

* Prime circuit with bypass solution  
Combination of heparinised crystalloid and colloid.


## Instituting CPB

Anaesthetist:

* Prepare 300 Units/kg heparin
	* Give heparin when requested  
	**Close loop**.
	* Check ACT **3 minutes** post UFH  
	Confirm ACT >480 prior to cannulation.
* Reduce SBP to 80-100mmHg to reduce risk of aortic dissection during cannulation
	* Too low and there is ↑ risk of puncturing the posterior wall of the aorta, leading to dissection
	* Too high and there is ↑ risk of aortic dissection from the anterior wall
* Connects coronary sinus cannula to PA transducer to monitor pressure during retrograde cardiopegia
* Confirm coronary sinus cannula is correctly sited  
Via TOE.
Used for retrograde cardioplegia.
* Monitor for LV distension with TOE  
May occur with anterograde cardioplegia if there is aortic regurgitation.


Surgeon:

* Places pericardial stay sutures  
May impair atrial filling and cause hypotension.
* Places aortic purse-string sutures
* Places atrial purse-string sutures  
May cause atrial arrhythmia. If unstable:
	* Temporise with vasopressor and volume, then go onto bypass
	* Synchronised DCR  
	Clutters surgical field.
* Places aortic return cannula
* Places atrial access cannula  
	* At this point, bypass may commence although the heart is still beating
	* Access cannula may be
		* Bi-caval  
		Two separate cannulas, one to the IVC and one to the SVC. Used if the RA has to be empty for surgical conditions (e.g. atrial myxoma, tricuspid valve surgery).
		* Single, larger dual-stage cannula
* Places retrograde cardioplegia cannula
* Places anterograde cardioplegia catheter
	* An LV vent (typically through the right upper pulmonary vein) may be placed if the anterograde cardioplegia causes LV distension
* Monitors heart as CPB initiated
* Cross-clamps aorta once on bypass

Perfusionist:

* Gradually releases clamp on venous line, ↑ bypass flow and reducing right heart CO
* Left heart empties due to reduced right sided CO  
Significant left sided CO at this stage implies a problem:
	* Obstruction of venous bypass line
	* Significant AR
	* PDA
* Deliver cardioplegia once aorta is cross clamped  
Typically contain high potassium and magnesium concentrations.
	* Produce asystole when rapidly infused
	* Cold cardioplegia is cardioprotective for ischaemia
	* Cardioplegia may be delivered:
		* Retrograde via the coronary sinus  
		Typically retrograde will preserve LV function better than anterograde, especially when there is AR or severe CAD. The same protection does not extend to the RV, as the RV is drained via the anterior cardiac veins.
			* Cardioplegia delivery will cause rise in coronary sinus pressure
		* Anterograde via the coronary arteries




## During CPB

Anaesthetist:

* Cease ventilation


Perfusionist:

* Deliver nonpulsatile flow of ~2.4L/min/m^2^ to approximate a normal CI
* Aim MAP 50-70mmHg
* Continue anaesthesia
	* Via TIVA
	* Via volatile agent  
	Can be vapourised into bypass circuit.
* Cool to 28-34°C  
Cooler temperatures provide better cerebral protection but require longer times for rewarming.
* Monitor blood gases and ACT  
Typically every 30 minutes, aiming:
	* Normal gas exchange
	* Hb > 60
	* BE < 2.5
	* ACT >400
* Continues to deliver cardioplegia as required
	* Typically every 10-15 minutes or at surgeon request
	* May deliver a **'hot shot'**
	Warmed cardioplegic blood given as the last bolus prior to rewarming.
		* ↓ chance of immediate post-operative arrhythmia
* Rewarms patient prior to weaning  
Ensure that central-peripheral temperature gradient is <2°C as this ↑ the risk of neurological complications.
	* Slow down rate of rewarming if this occurs


## Prior to Weaning

Complete a pre-wean checklist and confirm:

* A:
	* ETT is in situ
* B:
	* Hand ventilate both lungs and visually check for inflation  
	Re-establish FRC with a high FiO~2~ to reduce immediate shunt.
	* Appropriate blood gases on bypass circuit
* C:
	* Pacing box present
	* De-airing  
	Assess for residual air in cardiac chambers if open cardiac surgery performed.
	* Estimate what the patients cardiac state will likely be during wean and aim to optimise each facet:
		* Rate and Rhythm  
		Pacing wires in situ and pacing is set. A suggested approach:
			* AOO/AAI or DOO/DDD
			* High amplitudes (e.g. 16mA)  
			* High sensing threshold if using a synchronous mode  
			↓ chance of diathermy interference.
		* Preload  
		* Afterload  
		Start vasopressors or dilators that may be required.
		* Contractility  
		Start inotropes that may be required.
	* Reperfusion  
	Coronary flow prior to weaning off CPB. **10 minutes** per hour of cross-clamp time.
* D:
	* Confirm BSL 6-10 mmol/L
	* Method for delivery anaesthesia is present
* E:
	* Temperature >36.5°C
	* Ensure central-peripheral temperature gradient is < 2°C for rewarming  
	Slow down rate of separation if this temperature gradient exceeds this.
* F:
	* pH is 7.35-7.45
	* Potassium 4.5-5mmol/L
* H:
	* Hb > 70
	* Anticipate possible coagulopathy  
	Product should only be administered once separated from CPB.
		* Platelets  
		May be required if:
			* CKD
			* Long pump run
			* Antiplatelets pre-operatively
			* Reoperation
		* Factors/cryoprecipitate
		* DDAVP
			* CKD
			* von Willebrand disease
			* Platelet function abnormalities


## Weaning from CPB

Anaesthetist:

* Monitor cardiac function as heart is slowly refilled  
Adjust infusions if necessary. Ensure good flow rates of carrier fluid to enable rapid titration and reduce the effect of dead space.
* Optimise:
	* Preload  
	Evaluate with:
		* TOE
		* PADP
		* CVP
	* Contractility  
		* Evaluate with:
			* Ventricular performance on TOE
			Global EF and wall function
			* Rate of rise of the arterial line waveform 
			* Visual appearance of heart in chest
		* ↑ with:
			* Inotropes
			* IABP
			* ECMO
	* Afterload
	Note perfusing pressures (aim SBP <100mmHg during aortic decannulation), and optimise with:
		* Vasodilators
		* Vasopressors
	* Rate  
	Usually 80-100, though different physiology may be optimised at different rates.
		* Correct HR >120 prior to weaning  
		Usually ↑ preload during wean will reduce HR via atrial stretch.
		* Check epicardial pacing lead function
		* Consider pacing  
		Native conduction typically superior.
			* Generally pace 88-90 to improve CO during weaning period.  
			Atrial pacing preferred if AV node is functional.
			* DDD 88-90 at 15mA is a safe starting mode
			* Use higher sensitivities (e.g. ~7mV) for diathermy
	* Rhythm  
	Defibrillate if required; arrhythmias are common.
		* 10-20J, announce when charged
		* Defibrillate when surgeon instructs
		* May need multiple shocks if persistent VT/VF
		* Pharmacotherapy may be required:
			* IV amiodarone
			* Magnesium
			* Esmolol
* Reverse heparinisation **when fully off bypass**  
Give 1mg protamine per 100 units of UFH.
	* Don't draw up protamine (or hide it somewhere) until reversal is required
	* Monitor for systemic hypotension/pulmonary hypertension, high airway pressures, circulatory arrest  
	May need to crash back onto bypass.
	* Give test dose of 1-2ml initially
	* Given *slowly*, typically 2-3ml/min, titrating to patient blood pressure
	* Alert surgeons when half to 1/3^rd^ of protamine given  
	Avoid complete reversal whilst cardiotomy suction is still being used.
* Check ACT 3 minutes after protamine has finished


Perfusionist:

* Progressive clamping of the venous line  
Allows the heart to fill and eject.
	* Partial bypass can be sustained for some time if required


Surgeon:

* De-air the circulation if required  
i.e. if aorta or cardiac chambers opened.
* Ensure adequate haemostasis
* Remove venous access cannula
* Remove cardioplegia lines
* Remove aortic cannula


### Difficulty Weaning from Bypass

Assess cause; may be:

* Rate/rhythm
	* Conduction failure
	* Failure of pacing
* Preload
	* Inadequate volume
	* Tamponade
	* Bleeding
* Contractility
	* Ischaemia  
	Look for new RWMA.
		* Graft occlusion/dysfunction
		* Valve dislodgement
		* Air embolus
	* Myocardial stunning
		* Long bypass time
	* Metabolic
		* Electrolyte abnormalities
			* Residual cardioplegia
		* Acidosis
		* Hypothermia
	* Pulmonary HTN and RV failure
		* Hypoxia
		* Hypercarbia
		* Protamine
* Afterload
	* Vasoplegia
	* Residual cardioplegia


Check and optimise:

* Preload
	* Check EDV on TOE and filling pressures (CVP, PADP)
	* Give volume
* Contractility
	* Check systolic function on TOE, CI on PAC, and visual assessment over drapes
	* Give inotropes, consider IABP
* Afterload
	* Give vasopressors
* Rate  
Pace if <88.
* Rhythm  
Restore sinus rhythm.
* Anaesthetic factors
	* Electrolytes
	* Temperature
	* Gas exchange
* Surgical factors
	* Absence of major surgical problem
	* Absence of dynamic obstruction
	* Major bleeding controlled
	* Chambers de-aired


### After Weaning from CPB

Anaesthetist:

* Aim SBP 80-140mmHg
* Maintain high-normal potassium
* Check ABG, ACT, and TEG post reversal

## Complications

Use of bypass is associated with several complications including:

* A
	* Air emboli
		* CVA
		* CAGE
* C
	* Myocardial stunning  
	EF is reduced immediately post-bypass.
	* Dysrhythmias
	* Impaired organ perfusion, leading to post-bypass:
		* AKI	
		* Post-pump vasoplegia
* D
	* ↑ risk of anaesthetic awareness
* H
	* Coagulopathy
