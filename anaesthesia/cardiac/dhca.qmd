# Deep Hypothermic Circulatory Arrest

DHCA is a **neuroprotective strategy used** to ↓ risk of ischaemia **when surgical requirements demand complete cessation** of the **circulation**. DHCA involves controlled cooling via CBP:

:::column-margin
All organs are of course at risk of ischaemia during circulatory arrest, but the brain both particularly vulnerable and important.
:::

* Cooling occurs rapidly\
Generally a <10°C gradient maintained between blood and inflow temperature.
* Usually to 15-18°C\
Based on the anticipated duration of arrest.
	* Higher temperatures (22-25°C) can be used if selective cerebral perfusion is employed
* Rewarming occurs gradually\
<2°C between brain and inflow temperature.

:::column-margin
Inflow temperature is the temperature of blood returned by the CPB circuit, and is measured accurately by the machine.
:::

## Indications

* Cardiac surgery
	* Aortic arch surgery
	* Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy
	* Complex congenital surgery
* Neurological
	* Cerebral aneurysms
	* Intracranial AVM
* Vena caval surgery
	* Carcinoma with caval invasion

## Contraindications

## Principles

* Oxygen demand is a function of metabolic rate, and is strongly affected by hypothermia\
Cerebral metabolism ↓ by 6-7% for every 1°C ↓ in temperature.
* Safe cerebral ischaemic time is proportional to temperature\
**Most patients tolerate 30 minutes of DHCA at 18°C**.

## Practice

### Preparation

Should consider:

:::column-margin
There is little evidence for cerebral oximetry, ice, and use of corticosteroids; most institutions will have their own policy.
:::

:::column-margin
There is poor correlation between rectal and pulmonary artery catheter temperature and brain temperature. Nasopharyngeal and tympanic temperature are the best surrogate.
:::

* **Cerebral oximetry** monitoring
* **Processed EEG** monitoring
* **Two temperature probes**
	* Brain temperature\
	Nasopharynx.
	* Body temperature\
	Bladder.
* Ice for topical head cooling\
Delays brain *rewarming* during arrest, but does not contribute meaningfully to cooling.
* Corticosteroids\
1mg/kg prednisolone, ideally 6-8 hours before surgery.


### Cooling

* Ensure **adequate anticoagulation** prior
* Commence topical cooling of the head
* Consider TIVA rather than volatile\
Avoid uncoupling CMRO~2~ from metabolism.
* Monitor for VF\
This may result in AI and ventricular distention, which requires either:
	* Aortic cross-clamping and cardioplegia
	* Venting

### Cold

Considerations:

* **Turn off all infusions**, particularly vasopressors
	* ↓ Metabolism of infused drugs
	* No circulation of infused drugs\
	Will pool in the SVC, resulting in a bolus when circulation resumes.
* Acid-base measurement can use the pH or alpha-stat approach
	* pH-stat may be beneficial during cooling\
	Adding CO~2~ to the CPB circuit may improve neurological outcomes through more rapid and uniform cerebral cooling.
* **Haemodilution** to a **haematocrit** of **20%** may improve microcirculatory flow

:::column-margin
Alpha-stat vs. pH-stat is covered under @sec-ph_variability. In brief, alpha-stat warms a cold sample to 37°C; pH-stat adjusts the measured gas samples for the patient temperature which results in a lower partial pressure due to the ↑ in solubility.
:::

* Adequate storage for heparinised blood\
The patient is traditionally exsanguinated.
* Additional return lines for cerebral perfusion

### Cerebral Perfusion Strategies

Cerebral perfusion can prolong safe operating time or ↓ the degree of hypothermia required. Options include:

* Selective **anterograde cerebral perfusion**\
Perfusion of neck vessels with 10-20mL/kg/min of blood, maintaining some cerebral blood flow.
	* Cannulation or grafting of one or both carotid arteries, or the axillary or brachiocephalic artery
	* Right sided perfusion can be monitored targeting a right radial arterial pressure of 50-70mmHg
	* NIRS is particularly helpful to note the presence of perfusion and an intact Circle of Willis, and identify any interruptions (e.g. kinking) to flow
* **Intermittent systemic perfusion**\
Intermittent perfusion prolongs total duration of DHCA, but is not appropriate for all operations.
* **Retrograde cerebral perfusion**\
Perfusion of the brain with oxygenated blood administered retrograde into the SVC.
	* Relies on the fact that the cerebral vasculature has no valves
	* Patchy cerebral perfusion

:::column-margin
Retrograde cerebral perfusion likely operates mostly via the azygous system (the the IJV possess valves), whose tributaries cover (loosely) cerebral territories supplied by the posterior circulation.

+---------------------------------+------------------------------------+------------------------------+----------------------------+


### Rewarming

Prior to rewarming:

* De-air
* Restart infusions


During rewarming:

:::column-margin
TEG is covered under @sec-teg.
:::

* Consider cold reperfusion\
Restart CPB without rewarming, and continue for 10-20 minutes.
* **Slow rewarming** to minimise tissue thermal gradients
	* <2C
* Prevent secondary brain injury\
Avoid:
	* Hyperthermia
	* Hypoxaemia
	* Hypotension
	* Hypoperfusion
* Perform **thromboelastography**\
Warmed sample can provide early identification of clotting factor deficiencies.

## Complications

Profound hypothermia brings a raft of adverse effects:

* C
	* **Arrhythmia**
		* Proportional to degree of hypothermia
		* Partially related to ↓ K^+^
	* ↑ Plasma viscosity
	* ↑ SVR
* D
	* Cerebral vasoconstriction
	* ↑ **Stroke risk**\
	5-10%. Associated with:
		* Age
		* DHCA time
		* Aortic atheroma
	* POCD
	* Reperfusion injury
	* Hyperthermic injury
* E
	* Hypothermia\
	Temperature commonly falls after rewarming, and patients may become significantly hypothermic during the post-bypass phase.
		* This is ↓ by a slower rate of rewarming
* F
	* ↓ GFR
	* Metabolic acidosis
	* **↑ BSL**\
	↓ Glucose metabolism.
* H
	* **Coagulopathy**\
	Major contributor to early and late mortality.
	* Thrombocytopaenia
* Other
	* Altered pharmacokinetics
