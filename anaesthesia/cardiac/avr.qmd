# Aortic Valve Repair/Replacement

>Airway: ETT <br>
>Access: 14G IVC or MAC line, arterial line, CVC, +/- PAC <br>
>Pain: Substantial, especially in younger patients<br>
>Position: Supine/crucifix <br>
>Time: 3-4 hours  <br>
>Blood loss: G+H required. Cross-match if **re-do surgery**, anaemic, small, sick, or emergency. <br>
>Special: CPB - higher risk for anaesthetic awareness\

Intervention on the aortic valve is performed for:

* Stenosis\
Not amenable to repair.
* Regurgitation
* Stenosis/Regurgitation
* Endocarditis

Surgical techniques include:

* Replacement\
Typical, and may be performed with:
	* Bioprosthetic valves
		* Porcine or bovine
		* Do not require anticoagulation
		* Do not last as long as mechanical valves
	* Mechanical valves
		* Require anticoagulation
		* Last longer than bioprosthetic valves
	* Homografts\
	Rarely available.
* Repair\
Appropriate for isolated regurgitation, with or without associated aneurysm. Technique will depend on:
	* Cause of regurgitation\
	Defect of the the:
		* STJ\
		Supracoronary replacement of ascending aorta with prosthesis.
		* Annulus\
		Multiple techniques:
			* Annuloplasty ring\
			May be:
				* Extraaortic
				* Intraaortic
			* Plegeted sutures\
			Rarely permits complete stability of annulus.
		* Leaflets\
		Amenability to repair depends on valve morphology; particularly the ability to achieve an effective relationship between the:
			* Effective height\
			Height from annulus to leaflet tip.
			* Geometric height\
			Length of the valve leaflet.
			* Coaptation height\
			Height of leaflet contact during diastole.


## Considerations

*This covers factors unique to AVR. Factors relating to cardiac surgery in general are covered [here](/anaesthesia/cardiac/cardiac-principles.md#id).*

* B
	* Left heart failure
* C
	* LVH\
		* Often occurs secondary to AS
		* ↑ importance of good myocardial protection on CPB



## Preparation

*This covers factors unique to AVR. Factors relating to cardiac surgery in general are covered [here](/anaesthesia/cardiac/cardiac-principles.md#id).*

## Induction

* Haemodynamically stable induction is vital
	* Consider vasopressor infusion in critical AS.
	* Filling is important in AS and beneficial in AR

## Intraoperative

### Surgical Stages

* Median sternotomy
* Bicaval and aortic cannulation
* Establishement of CPB
* LV drained via PA
* Cardioplegia administered
* Aorta opened and existing valve excised and annulus debrided
* Annulus measured and valvular prostehesis sutured in place\
Rewarming during final stages of valvular implantation.
* Filing of the LV during aortic closure
* Left heart de-aired in the **head down** position
* Decannulation and reversal of heparinisation

## Postoperative

Aortic Stenosis:

* The rapid ↓ in AV gradient leads to rapid ↓ in PCWP and LVEDP, and ↑ in SV
* Myocardial function typically improves rapidly
* Diastolic dysfunction persists\
Remain very preload and afterload dependent until LV reverse remodelling completes.
