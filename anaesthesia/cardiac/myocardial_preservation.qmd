# Myocardial Preservation

Methods to reduce myocardial injury include:

* General
	* Cardiovascular stable anaesthetic
	* Hb 7-10g/dL
	* MAP >65mmHg
	* CPP >50mmHg
	* Low HR
	* Avoid ventricular distension\
	↑ wall tension and VO~2~; resolve with venting.
	* Ensure good venous return to reservoir
* Preconditioning\
Exposure to stimulus reduces subsequent ischaemic injury.
	* Ischaemic
	* Pharmacological
		* Halogenated volatiles
		* Xenon
		* Opioids
		* Adenosine
		* β-blockers
		* Lignocaine
		* Nicorandil
* Cardioplegia\
Goal is to maintain electromechanical arrest.
	* Reduces myocardial VO~2~ to ~20%
	* Provides O~2~ and glucose
	* Multiple types
* Hypothermia\
	* Reduces O~2~ demand\
	~50% per 10°C.
	* Promotes electromechanical arrest


## Cardioplegia

Options may include:

* Blood\
Oxygen and buffering capacity.
	* Hb ~5g/dL
* Crystalloid


Reperfusion may be:

* Warm or cold
* Intermittent or continuous
