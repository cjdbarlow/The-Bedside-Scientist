# Mitral Valve Repair/Replacement

>Airway: ETT <br>
>Access: 14G IVC or MAC line, arterial line, CVC, +/- PAC <br>
>Pain: Substantial, especially in younger patients<br>
>Position: Supine/crucifix <br>
>Time: 3-4 hours  <br>
>Blood loss: ~400ml. G+H required, consider cross-match of at least 2 units.<br>
> Special: CPB - higher risk for anaesthetic awareness. Risk of air embolism as left heart is opened.


Mitral valvular surgery is performed for:

* Mitral Stenosis
* Mitral regurgitation
* Endocarditis


The valve can be either:

* Repaired\
Typically for:
	* Posterior leaflet abnormalities
	* Annula dilation
* Replaced:
	* Severe MS




## Considerations

*This covers factors unique to MVR. Factors relating to cardiac surgery in general are covered [here](/anaesthesia/cardiac/cardiac-principles.md#id).*

* A
	* OLV required for minimally invasive approach 
	Need either DLT or bronchial blocker.
* B
	* Pulmonary oedema\
	May have secondary effusions.
* C
	* Atrial fibrillation
		* Often coexistent due to atrial dilation\
		May be anticoagulated.
		* AF may result in precipitous decline in both MS and MR
	* Severity of valvular disease
	* Consequences of valvular disease
		* PHTN
		* Cardiac remodelling
	* Presence of coronary disease
	* Pulmonary artery hypertension\
	May be associated with both MR and MS.
	* Defend perfusion pressure
		* MS leads to a relatively fixed CO and elevated SVR; therefore CBF will fall and not be compensated with a fall in perfusion pressure
	* Avoid elevation in PVR


## Induction

## Intraoperative

### Surgical Stages

For standard approach:

* Sternotomy
* Establish CPB
* Empty left heart via the PA
* Establish diastolic arrest
* Open the LA
* Decision made for repair or replacement, and this is performed
* LV and atrium are filled
* Atrium is closed
* Ventricle is de-aired
* Cross-clamp is removed and coronary perfusion commences
* Wean from CPB occurs once air is removed from circulation


Minimally invasive approach:

* Patient positioned in left lateral (right side up)
* CPB established typically by peripheral (femoral-femoral) cannulation
* Deflation of the right lung required to facilitate surgical access
* Diastolic arrest and cross-clamping

## Postoperative

* May require vasodilator due to residual pulmonary hypertension
