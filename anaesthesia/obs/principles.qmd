# Obstetric Considerations


*This covers the key considerations when anaesthetising the obstetric patient for both obstetric and non-obstetric surgery. Other physiological factors are covered under [physiology of pregnancy](/disease/obs/preg.md#physiol)*.

## Physiological Changes of Pregnancy

* A
	* Airway oedema  
	MP score decreases both during pregnancy and during labour.
		* Avoid nasal airways
* B
	* Compensated respiratory acidosis  
	Due to ↑ MV.
	* Decreased O<sub>2</sub> store  
	↓ FRC and ↑ VO<sub>2</sub>.
	* ↑ V/Q mismatch
* C
	* ↑ HR and CO
	* ↓ SVR and BP
	* ↑ Circulating volume
	* Note **[hypertension of pregnancy](/disease/obs/htn.md)**  
	Regional is more stable than GA if **not intravascularly deplete**.
* F
	*  ↑ RBF, GFR, and creatinine clearance
* G
	* ↑ **Aspiration** risk  
	Combination of ↑ intragastric pressure and ↓ oesophageal sphincter tone.
		* Suggest **premedication** with:
			* Ranitidine 150mg
			* Sodium Citrate 30ml
			* Metoclopramide 10mg IV
	* Mildly deranged LFTs
	* ↓ Plasma protein concentration  
	 ↑ Unbound drug levels.
* H
	* Dilutional anaemia
	* Potential for massive maternal haemorrhage from uterine surgery
		* Crossmatch required


## Indications for Antenatal Anaesthetic Assessment

**Anaesthetic Indications:**
* Previous anaesthetic complication
	* Difficult or failed intubation
	* Anaphylaxis
	* Malignant hyperthermia
	* Suxamethonium apnoea
	* Complications from previous neuraxial
* Previous obstetric analgesia complication
	* Painful labour/delivery despite anaesthetic involvement
	* Painful caesarian


**Patient Indications**:

* Respiratory disease
	* That impairs ADLs
* Cardiac disease
	* Valvular disease
	* Arrhythmias
	* Congenital cardiac disease
	* PPM/ICD
	* Pulmonary hypertension
* Neurological disorder
	* MS
	* MG
	* Intracranial lesions
* Spinal cord problem
	* Spinal cord injury
	* Previous back surgery
	* Congenital abnormalities
	* Spinal anatomy that may limit neuraxial options
* Haematological disorder
	* Bleeding abnormalities or disorders
* Other
	* Severe systemic disease
	* Morbid obesity
	* Refusal of blood products
	* Patient request
