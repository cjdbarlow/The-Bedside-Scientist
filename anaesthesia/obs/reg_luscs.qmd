# Regional Anaesthesia for Caesarian Section

*[General principles](luscs.md) of caesarian section and [general anaesthesia for caesiarian](ga-luscs.md) are covered separately.*

Provision of regional anaesthesia for a [caesarian section](/luscs.md):

* Has many advantages over GA:
	* Mother and support person can be present at delivery
	* Lower risk\
	Predominantly due to less aspiration.
	* Alert neonate\
	Early bonding and breastfeeding.
	* Better postoperative analgesia and mobilisation
	* Reduced chronic post-surgical pain
* Requires a **block level from T4-S4** to light touch and ice
* Can be performed with:
	* Single-shot **spinal**\
	Most (>90%) CS are performed under spinal.
		* Rapid onset
		* Simple (usually)
		* < 1% failure rate
		* More rapid sympathectomy than epidural, leading to greater haemodynamic disturbance\
		Can be avoided with use of phenylephrine infusion.
		* Shorter acting, and difficult to correct\
		Avoid if procedure is expected to be >2 hours in duration.
	* **Epidural top-up**\
	Used when a working epidural is already present\
		* Easy
		* Greater haemodynamic stability at cost of slower onset\
		The poorer the initial block, the harder it is to top up.
		* Generally poorer block than spinal
		* Additional top-up can be given intraoperatively
		* Epidural can be used for post-operative analgesia
	* **CSE**
		* Technically more difficult
		* Greater haemodynamic stability
		* Allows block to be extended if surgery is prolonged
		* Epidural can be used for post-operative analgesia

## Considerations

* E
	* BMI\
	Affects technical difficulty.
	* Previous back surgery\
	May make procedure harder or inadvisable.


## Preparation

Adequate patient preparation and **expectation management** is key:

* Discuss with patient that:
	* Spinal does not remove all sensation
	* It will be uncomfortable at certain points, and this is normal
		* Pull prior to uterine incision
		* Upper abdominal pressure to deliver baby
	* Pain should not occur
* Sitting position preferred if patient will tolerate this
* Premedication is acceptable for anxiolysis
	* Midazolam 0.02mg/kg


## Induction and Maintenance

>"It is easier to manage a high block than an inadequate one"

Covers:

* [Single-shot spinal](#sss)
* [Epidural top-up](#etu)
* [Combined Spinal-Epidural](#cse)

### Single-shot Spinal{#sss}

*Detailed approach to performance of spinal anesthesia is covered [here](/anaesthesia/regional/spinal.md).*

* Perform spinal\
[Many different options for dosing](#dosing). A reliable recipe (with a total volume of 3ml) is:
	* 2.2ml of 0.5% heavy bupivacaine
	* 15μg of fentanyl
	* 100μg intrathecal morphine
* Lie supine with pillow
	* Trendelenburg can be used to ↑ the cranial spread
	* Reverse Trendelenburg will reduce cranial spread \
	↑ the degree of tilt if block is rising/rises too cranially.
* Place wedge
* Commence phenylephrine infusion\
30ml/hr of 100μg/ml solution.
* Test the block
	* No block\
		* Consider repeat spinal\
		May cause exaggerated haemodynamic response.
		* Consider GA
	* Inadequate block\
	Consider epidural and slow titration of LA.

#### Principles of Spinal Dosing{#dosing}

In general:

* Much research has been done
* Little of it demonstrates significant superiority for one technique over another
* Local anaesthetics:
	* Bupivacaine 8-12mg\
	Block will recede after 1.5 hours, though some block will remain after 2.5 hours.
		* Hyperbaric bupivacaine has a more rapid onset and the level can be adjusted by moving the table
	* Lignocaine generally avoided because of transient neurological symptoms
	* Ropivacaine has a much shorter intrathecal duration of action
* Opioids\
May be added to improve analgesia intra- and post-operatively.
	* Fentanyl 10-25μg
	* Morphine 50-150μg\
	Provides longer lasting analgesia in exchange for risks of PONV, pruritis (can be severe), and late respiratory depression.


### Epidural Top-Up{#etu}

* Examine the back and make sure the catheter has not moved
* Test the current block\
* Incrementally top up epidural
	* 2% lignocaine with 1:200,000 of adrenaline\
	10-12ml initial bolus, with further 5ml Q2-3 min, up to 7mg/kg.
	* Additional opioid\
	e.g. 100μg fentanyl.
* Test the block\
	* No block\
	Catheter may be inadequately positioned. Consider:
		* Resiting epidural
		* Performing spinal
	* Inadequate block\
	Epidural may be resited or withdrawn.
		* Consider
			* Further top-up\
			Ensure that further top-ups will not prohibit performing a spinal if required.
			* Spinal
		* If LA dose limit has been reached:
			* Consider abandoning\
			For elective procedures.
			* Convert to GA\
			For emergency procedures.
* Post-operative analgesia
	* Consider 1.5mg epidural morphine during skin closure for post-operative analgesia\
	Avoid if any suspicion of intrathecal catheter.

### Combined Spinal-Epidural{#cse}

* Sit patient up
* Perform CSE\
Can be performed as:
	* Needle-through-needle technique
	* Two-needle technique
* Dosing
	* Most cases given a full-dose spinal with subsequent epidural top-up if required
	In addition to top up with LA, 10mls 0.9% NaCl can be given through the epidural to compress the dural sac and encourage cranial spread of intrathecal LA.
	* Can alternatively give a half-dose spinal, followed by intentional titration\
	More haemodynamically stable, and confirms adequate positioning of epidural.
* Test the block\
As per [epidural top-up](#etu).


## Complications of Regional Techniques in Caesarian Section

Bradycardia:

* May be due to vena cava compression or blockade of cardioaccelerator fibres
* Should be treated if <50 and associated with hypotension
* 200-400ug glycopyrrolate is the preferred agent\
Does not cross placenta.

Nausea and vomiting: 
* Predominantly due to hypotension
* May be due to visceral manipulation or rapid administration of oxytocic\
Amenable to vasopressors.


Hypotension:

* First line treatment should be pressor agents\
Adjust phenylephrine infusions, covered [here](#prep).


Inadequate blockade/Pain:

* Generally due to no block of high thoracic dermatomes
* Alternate technique required in up to 10%
* Additional analgesia required in up to 15%\
Options include:
	* **Conversion to GA**\
		* Offer early and often
		* ***Usually* required if pain prior to delivery**
		* Generally comply with this if the patient requests it and risk is not extreme
		* Often required if pain occurs before foetal delivery
		* Occurs in 2%
	* Supplemental analgesia
		* Epidural top-up (if available)
		* Nitrous oxide
		* IV opioid\
		Alert paediatrics if this is given prior to delivery. Short acting agents preferred:
			* Alfentanil
			* Fentanyl
		* Sedation\
		Midazolam 1-2mg IV.
		* Ketamine\
		10-30mg IV. Pretreat with midazolam.
		* Additional local anaesthetic by obstetric team\
		Can be delivered locally to site of wound, especially if pain occurs during closure.


High block:

* Common
* Reassurance adequate in the majority
* Occasionally requires supplemental oxygen
* Upper limb motor block usually indicates requirement for ETT
