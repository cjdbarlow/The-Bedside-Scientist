# Cardiac Disease in Pregnancy

*This describes the general management of the pregnant patient with cardiac disease. Management of [peripartum cardiomyopathy](/disease/cvs/peripartum.md) is covered elsewhere.*

> * Risk of pregnancy depends on specific disease and patients condition, individual counselling by experts is recommended
> * Risk stratification is important, and even the lowest-risk patients still have up to 5% risk of peripartum

Pregnancy is a:

* Significant circulatory burden  
Achieving a term pregnancy demonstrates presence of physiological reserve.
* Time where underlying cardiac disease is diagnosed

## Epidemiology and Risk Stratification

Risk stratification can use:

* Risk prediction model  
Provides good general-purpose stratification for patients who may have very individual disease, and a spread of functional stratifications within their lesion.
	* ZAHARA
	* CARPREG II
* WHO Classification  
Comprehensive but may be less useful as does not stratify lesions by severity of that individuals pathology.



### CARPREG II

Predictors:

* General
	* Prior cardiac events  
	Includes:
		* Failure
		* Stroke/TIA
		* Arrhythmias
	* NYHA III/IV or resting SpO~2~ <90%
	* High-risk valve disease/LVOT obstruction
	* Mild or greater systemic ventricular dysfunction
	* No previous cardiac intervention
* Lesion-specific
	* Mechanical valves
	* High-risk aortopathies
	* Pulmonary hypertension
	* Coronary artery disease
* Care related
	* Late pregnancy assessment

### WHO Risk Stratification

Low (WHO I) risk:

* Cardiology followup limited to one or two visits
* Includes:
	* Uncomplicated or mild:
		* PS
		* PDA
		* MV prolapse
	* Repaired lesions
	* Isolated ectopics



Moderate (WHO II) risk:

* Require cardiology followup every trimester
* Includes:
	* Uncorrected ASD or VSD
	* Repaired ToF
	* Most arrhythmias



Moderate-severe (WHO II-III) risk:

* Classification depends on individual presentation
* Includes:
	* Mild LV dysfunction
	* HCM
	* Valvular heart disease that is not WHO I or WHO IV
	* Repaired coarctation



Severe (WHO III) risk:

* High risk of complications requiring *at least* monthly cardiology and obstetric review
* Mechanical valve
* Systemic RV/Fontan
* Cyanotic heart disease
* Other complex congenital heart disease
* Aortic dilatation 40-45mm in Marfan's
* Aortic dilatation 45-50mm with bicuspid AV



Critical (WHO IV) risk:

* Pregnancy contraindicated  
Pregnant women who will not consider termination require at least monthly review.
* Includes:
	* PAH
	* Severe LV dysfunction  
	NYHA III-IV or LVEF <30%.
	* Previous peripartum cardiomyopathy
	* Severe MS
	* Severe symptomatic AS
	* Marfan's with aorta ⩾45mm
	* Aortic dilatation ⩾50mm with bicuspid AV
	* Severe coarctation



### Contraindications to Pregnancy  

Disease of such risk that pregnancy is considered a contraindication include:

* Severe Pulmonary Hypertension  
Mortality up to 50%.
* Severe obstructive cardiac disease
	* HOCM
	* Aortic stenosis
	* Mitral stenosis
	* Pulmonary stenosis
	* Unrepaired coarctation
* NYHA III or IV heart failure
* Marfan's disease with aortic root ≥4cm


## Pathophysiology

Key conditions:

* Mitral stenosis is the most common lesion in the pregnant patient  
Poorer prognosis with decompensated disease, i.e.:
	* AF  
	May precipitate cardiac failure.
	* Pulmonary hypertension
	* May be treated with percutaneous commissurotomy 
* Marfan's syndrome  
	* Aortic dissection  
	Very high risk due to hyperdynamic circulation.
	* Requires monthly echocardiography
		* Aortic root dilatation >50mm strongly consider delivery
	* Vaginal delivery possible if aorta <40mm  
	Risk of straining leading to dissection.
* Pulmonary Hypertension
	* Highest risk is in the week following delivery



Consequences:

* Neonate  
Complications occur in 20-38% of women with cardiac disease, with key risk factors being:
	* NYHA >II
	* Maternal LVOT obstruction
	* Smoking
	* Multiple gestation
	* Use of oral anticoagulants
	* Mechanical valve


## Clinical Manifestations

Assessment aims are to determine level of function:

* Exercise tolerance
* HR, BP, and SpO~2~
* Medical therapy  
With particular attention to:
	* Amiodarone
	* Warfarin
	* ACE-I/A2RBs

## Investigations

Key investigations include:

* Bloods
	* Haemoglobin
	* Coagulation status
* ECG
* Echocardiogram
* Cardiac MRI


## Management

Preparation:

* Multidisciplinary approach
* Tertiary centre
* Adult ICU available
* Invasive monitoring required
* Optimise underlying cardiac disease  
Manage the lesion.
	* Note prognosis is often worse due to the higher CO demand
* Echocardiography for any pregnant patient with new or changing symptoms
* If requiring surgery, delivery should be considered after 28 weeks


Delivery:

* Vaginal delivery preferred in:
	* Severe hypertension  
	Aim for a "stress free" labour.
		* Early epidural is recommended  
		Beware the fixed cardiac-output state.
* Vaginal delivery **not** preferred in:
	* Aortic dissection
	* Marfans syndrome with severe aortic root dilatation
* Caesarian delivery considered in:
	* Aortic dilation >45mm
	* Severe AS
	* Pre-term labour on anticoagulants
	* Eisenmenger's syndrome
	* Severe heart failure


### Anaesthetic Considerations

* C
	* Nature of lesion
		* Shunts  
		Required SpO~2~ and ETCO~2~.
		* Air embolisation
	* Vascular access
	* **Circulation goals**
		* Enhance pulmonary flow
		* Optimise CO
		* Optimise oxygenation
* D
	* Anaesthetic technique
		* Regional
			* Advantages
				* Partner in room
				* Avoids risks of GA
				* Allows slow titration of anaesthetic  
				CSE or epidural.
				* Better post-operative analgesia
				* Reduced blood loss
				* Reduced PONV
			* Disadvantages
				* Anticoagulation
				* Maternal anxiety  
				Subsequent CVS effects.
				* Complications of regional
				* Cannot give 100% oxygen
		* General
			* Advantages
				* Anticoagulation status not relevant
				* Reduced maternal anxiety
				* Easier invasive vascular access
				* Facilitate DCR
			* Disadvantages
				* Airway and ventilation risks
				* Haemodynamic perturbation  
				Especially at intubation and extubation.
				* Effect of anaesthetic agents
					* Negative inotropy
					* Cardiac conduction abnormalities
					* Reduced SVR
					* Tocolysis
				* Risk of awareness
				* Greater blood loss
				* Poorer post-operative analgesia, PONV
* I
	* Endocarditis prophylaxis  
	Required in the setting of:
		* Unrepaired cyanotic CHD
		* Repaired CHD with prosthesis  
		In first 6 months.
		* Repaired CHD with residual defects	


## Complications

Consequences of cardiac disease in pregnancy include:

* Maternal
	* **Arrhythmias**
	* **Heart failure**
	* Embolism  
	* CVA
	* Death
* Foetal
	* SGA
	* Prematurity
	* Death
