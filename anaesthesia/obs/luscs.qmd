# Principles of Caesarean Section 


*This covers general principles of caesarian section. Particulars of caesarian section performed under [general](ga-luscs.md) or [regional](reg-luscs.md) anaesthesia are covered elsewhere.*

>Time: 45 to 90 minutes <br>
>Pain: Significant opioid requirement post-operatively<br>
>Position: Supine. <br>
>Blood loss: G+H required. Typically 500-100, but can be substantial. <br>
>Special Drugs: Uterotonics.

Caesarian section is delivery of a foetus through an abdominal incision. A caesarian section can be performed:

* At **different degrees of urgency**  
Divided into 4 categories:
	* **Cat 1**  
	Imminent threat to life of mother or foetus.
		* Objective is to deliver baby as rapidly as possible whilst being safe  
		**Epidural top-up (if available) or GA otherwise**. Spinal is associated with ~8-10 minute additional anaesthetic time.
	* **Cat 2**  
	Maternal or foetal compromise that is not imminently life threatening.
	* **Cat 3**  
	No compromise, but requires early delivery.
	* **Cat 4**  
	No compromise, delivery timed to suit the mother and the hospital.
* With **different techniques**:
	* **[General Anaesthesia](ga-luscs.md)**  
		* Quick to perform and reliable
		* Allows fastest delivery of baby
		* Generally increased risk of complications
		* Indications:
			* Maternal request
			* Cat 1 CS without pre-existing epidural  
			* Contraindication to regional technique
			* Failure of regional technique  
			May be:
				* Prior to incision
				* After incision  
				Limited consent and preparation time.
			* Expected massive haemorrhage
	* **[Regional](reg-luscs.md)**  
		* Preferred method in absence of contraindications
		* Includes:
			* Spinal
			* CSE
			* Epidural top-up


## Considerations{#considerations}

Indication:

* Expected duration
* Combined surgery  
e.g. With salpingectomy or hysterectomy.


* A
	* Probably higher risk of difficult airway
		* Mallampati score increases both during pregnancy and during labour
	* Higher risk of aspiration
* B
	* Reduced FRC and increased VO<sub>2</sub> in pregnancy lead to faster desaturation
	* Respiratory function may be compromised with regional techniques
* C
	* HDx state may be compromised with regional techniques  
	Avoid if significant antepartum blood loss.
* D
	* Consent  
	Depth of consent will be tailored to clinical urgency.
	* Anxiety
		* Often first exposure many people have to the hospital system  
		Aim to make it a positive one.
		* Regional and neuraxial anaesthesia are anxiety-inducing
* G
	* Antacid prophylaxis
* H
	* Group and Hold  
	There is always a risk of massive haemorrhage with obstetric cases.
* O
	* Placenta position  
	Low-lying anterior placenta greatly increases risk of major haemorrhage, especially if there is a scar from previous CS.
	* Obstetric history
		* Key questions:
			* Previous gestations
			* Previous caesarians
			* Issues with current pregnancy
		* Key obstetric factors:
			* Pre-eclampsia  
			Generally, early epidural prior to thrombocytopenia is preferred.
			* Prematurity  
			Generally, regional techniques reduce foetal morbidity.
			* Post-dates  
				* Often require LUSCS
				* Regional techniques generally preferred
			* Breech presentation
				* Elective LUSCS improves neonatal outcomes
				* Regional preferred in elective LUSCS
			* Multiple Gestation
				* Early epidural provides route enables quick conversion to LUSCS in second-twin distress
				* GA for cat 1 LUSCS
			* Placenta praevia  
			Requires caesarian, cannot undergo spontaneous labour.
			* Placental adhesive disorders  
			High risk of haemorrhage and requirement for hysterectomy. 


## Preparation{#prep}

* Give **antacid prophylaxis**
	* Ranitidine 150mg PO  
	2 hours prior to surgery.
	* 30ml sodium citrate  
	Immediately prior.
* Standard ANZCA monitoring  
Cycle BP cuff minutely from induction until delivery.
	* Treat hypotension aggressively with vasopressor  
	Treat nausea aggressively with vasopressor, as this is often a sign of hypotension.
* Give supplemental oxygen if < 95% on air
* **Wedge**  
Under right hip to displace the gravid uterus off the IVC, and ensure venous return.
* Large IVC  
16G or bigger ideal, 18G acceptable.
* Start phenylephrine infusion on commencement of anaesthesia, aiming to preserve the baseline BP  
**Generally 30**-60**ml/hr of 100ug/ml of phenylephrine**.
	* Adjust infusion rate each minute depending on the blood pressure  
	25-50% increments are reasonable.
	* Phenylephrine is the preferred agent as it does not constrict the spiral arteries
	* 100μg bolus can be used to treat hypotension
* Ensure **uterotonics available**
* Prophylactic antibiotics  
Should be given prior to skin incision.


## Intraoperative

This section is divided into:

* Surgical stages
* General complications of CS
* Complications of regional techniques in CS
* Complications of GA in CS


### Surgical Stages

* Test block (if regional)
* Transverse laparotomy  
Generally little muscle relaxation is required.
* Peritoneal retraction
* Uterine incision  
If amnion is intact then amniotic fluid will enter abdominal cavity.
* Delivery  
Provision of **routine uterotonics** after delivery.
* Uterine closure and haemostasis


### Uterotonics

Uterotonics are routinely given to reduce PPH risk. General recommendations:

* Oxytocin or carbetocin should be given immediately following delivery  
Inadvertent administration prior to delivery may be catastrophic.
* Second-line agents should be considered early
* IM is a reasonable alternative to IV infusions in resource-limited settings
* Dose requirements for **intrapartum** caesarian are increased compared to elective caesarian


Dosing of first line agents:

* Oxytocin 5 IU IV and then an infusion 10 IU/hr
	* Recommendations for dosing vary widely between official bodies, from 1-10U IV, with infusions from at 2.5-15 IU/hr  
	* Oxytocin should be given slowly to avoid adverse effects
* Carbetocin 100μg slow IV


Dosing of second line agents:

* Ergometrine 200-500μg  
	* Contraindicated in pre-eclampsia  
	* Can give half IV, half IM
* Carboprost 250μg IM  
	* Contraindicated IV
	* Contraindicated in asthma
	* Can be given every 15 minutes up to 8 doses.
* Sulprostone 500μg; given at 100μg/hr.


### General Complications of CS

* Massive haemorrhage
* Amniotic fluid embolism
* Post-partum haemorrhage  
Typically due to poor tone.
	* Uterine massage
	* Oxytocin


## Postoperative

Most departments have a standard post-operative analgesia management protocol. Consider:

* Paracetamol 1g QID
* Ibuprofen 400mg TDS
* Tramadol 50-100mg IV/PO QID
* Ondansetron 4-8mg IV/SL TDS


If intrathecal morphine given:

* Naloxone 40μg SC Q1H  
For itch.
* Naloxone 100μg IV Q5 min  
For RR ⩽8.


If no intrathecal morphine given:

* Oxycontin 20mg SR BD (wean in 1-2/7)
