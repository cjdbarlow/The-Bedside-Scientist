# Radiation Safety


Ionising radiation is:

* Used regularly for diagnosis and intervention
* Harmful  
Significant statutory regulations exist to reduce this harm. Exposure should be:
	* As Low as Reasonably Practicable
	* Justified

## Radiobiology

Ionising radiation:

* Consists of charged particles that transfer energy to a medium they pass through  
Known as linear energy transfer, measured in kiloelectrovolts/micrometer.
	* X-rays and gamma radiation is relatively low LET
	* α-particles and neutrons are high LET
* Dosage is quantified using two SI units
	* Gray (Gy)  
	Absorption of 1J/1kg of matter.
	* Sievert (Sv)  
	Derived unit of dose-equivalent radiation, for x-rays Sv is identical to Gy.
* Mechanism of injury is **direct** or **indirect**:
	* Direct  
	Predominant mechanism of high LET.
		* Direct ionisation of atoms or molecules, leading to biological damage
	* Indirect
		* Predominant mechanism of low LET
		* Energy displaces electrons from water molecules and generates free radicals  
		* Free radicals lead to DNA disruption  
* Damage is classified by two methods:
	* **Somatic** or **genetic**
		* Somatic  
		Effect on the individual. May be:
			* Acute  
				* Present usually in hours-days
				* Short duration of high exposure
				* Clinical effect depends on the dose
					* High dose causes cell death
					* Lower doses cause damage that is either repaired or contributes to carcinogenesis
			* Chronic
				* Present usually in months-years
				* Clinical effects include:
					* Chronic inflammation  
					Fibrosis, atrophy, ulceration.
					* Cancer  
					Most commonly AML, CML, and skin, bone, lung, thyroid, and breast cancers.
		* Genetic  
		Effect on offspring, via mutations passed on via gametes.
	* **Deterministic** or **stochastic**
		* Deterministic  
		Dose-dependent manifestation.
		* Stochastic  
		Magnitude of effect is independent of dose, though likelihood increases with increasing dose.
			* e.g. Carcinogenesis


## Radiation Safety

Principles:

* Ensure exposure is justified:
	* Objective of exposure
	* Total potential diagnostic and therapeutic benefit
	* Harm of exposure
	* Risk-benefit of technique
* Use appropriate imaging technique
	* Lowest exposure possible
	* Pulsed rather than continuous screening
	* Move source close to object as possible
	* Use laser to accurately position II prior to exposure
	* Use beam collimation  
	Reduces size and divergence of beam; improving image quality and reducing exposure area.
* Minimise exposure
	* Restrict presence of staff and other persons
	* Provide PPE  
	Ensure proper use, application, and storage.
* Pregnancy and breastfeeding
	* Prevent >1mSv dose to foetus
	* Prevent bodily contamination for breastfeeding employees
	* Pregnant employees notify employer
