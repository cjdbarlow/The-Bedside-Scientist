# Drug Safety in Anaesthesia


Medication error is a major cause of morbidity in anaesthetic practice.

## Definitions

Key terms:

* **Error**  
Failure of intended plan to be completed, or the use of a wrong plan to achieve a goal. May be of:
	* Commission
	* Omission
* **Medication error**  
An error in the medication process; irrespective of consequences.
* **Adverse drug reaction**  
Injury related to use of a drug. Independent of error.
* **Preventable**  
Harm that could have been avoided through reasonable planning or correct execution of a plan.
* **Near miss**  
Error that does not result in harm.
* **Slip**  
Failure to execute an action due to misdirection of routine behaviour.
* **Lapse**  
Failure to execute an action due to lapse in memory causing omission of a routine behaviour.


## Risk Factors

Anaesthetic-related drug errors are associated with:

* Self
	* General inexperience
	* Unfamiliarity with drug
	* Unfamiliarity with environment
	* Haste
	* Inattention
		* Fatigue
		* Hungry
		* Angry
		* Late
		* Tired
	* Mathematics
		* Dilutions
* Environment
	* Overnight
	* Poor communication
	* Restricted visual field
	* Poor labeling  
	Including:
		* Ampoule
		* Syringes
		* Unlabeled syringes
	* Situational chaos
* Patient
	* Emergency case

## Minimisation

Focuses on:

* Self
	* Maintain vigilance  
		* Adequate breaks
		* Self-discipline
	* Process rules:
		* Only handle one medicine at a time
		* Quarantine preparation  
		Avoid distraction during preparation.
		* Check every vial before and after drawing up
		* Label all syringes and IV bags
		* Use a standard order and syringe tray
		* Do not draw up medications until required
		* Do not draw up reversal and relaxant at the same time  
		They are never needed together.
		* Always use a red syringe for NMBA
		* Draw up the whole ampoule of NMBA into the syringe
		* Do not use red syringes for reversal
		* Have a separate section for storing:
			* Medicines given in an emergency
			* Medicines given by a route *other* than IV  
			e.g. Local anaesthetics.
			* Medicines that would be harmful outside of the specific purpose  
			e.g. Oxytocin, protamine.
* Environment
	* Reduce complexity
	* Organised drug trolleys  
	Unique within one area of department.
	* Use of pre-filled syringes
* Team
	* Double-checking of ampoules
	* Audit of errors
