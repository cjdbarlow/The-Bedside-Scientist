# Laser Safety


Lasers are common in ENT and opthalmic surgery. Lasers:

* Facilitate:
	* Accurate control  
	Requires the guiding (red helium) laser to be zeroed accurately so it matches the site of the therapeutic beam.
	* Minimal bleeding
	* Minimal local tissue reaction
* Are a hazard to both patients and staff  
Due to risk of:
	* Eye injury
	* Burns
	* Airborne contamination
* Have controls to ensure safety  
These are classified into:
	* Engineering controls
	* Administrative controls
	* Procedural controls

## Risks

Include:

* Eye injury  
Lasers cause tissue destruction by heating water. Different wavelengths cause tissue injury at different depths:
	* Long-wavelength  
	CO~2~ and Er:YAG lasers may burn the cornea directly.
		* Usually not permanent
		* Very painful
	* Mid-range infrared  
	Ho:YAG lasers partially burn and transmit through the cornea.
		* May damage cornea as a long-wavelength laser
		* May damage the lens
	* Short wavelength  
	Penetrate through water and the anterior structures of the eye.
		* May cause permanent retinal damage
* Fire and heat injury  
Energy from the laser may potentially cause:
	* Fire:
		* Dry/non-woven fabric
		* Plastic
		* Rubber
		* Alcoholic solutions
		* Tape removers
	* Chemical burns
		* Wet iodophor solutions
	* Melting  
	Some equipment won't burn, but will melt. This includes:
		* Some surgical drapes
* Airborne contamination  
High-power laser results in evaporation of cellular components; including viruses, bacteria, and mutagenic DNA. This is in addition to the standard toxic gases present in smoke.

## Safety

> **Communication is critical** and underpins all of these safety considerations

Methods include:

* Engineering Controls
	* Guarded footswitch
	* Audible and visible emission indicators
	* Stand-by control
	* Emergency shut-off
	* Beam attenuators
* Administrative controls
	* Laser Safety Officer  
	Responsible for risk, and authority to force compliance with rules.
	* Laser Safety Committee
	* Formal audit process of issues
* Procedural controls
	* Eye protection  
		* Protective eyewear worn at all times, including by the operator  
		Needs to be specific to the laser in use.
	* Remove flammable substances  
		* Use matte drapes
		* Remove cosmetics at operative site  
		Hairspray, gels, mousse, nail polish.
		* Remove reflective materials from beam path
		* Use a **laser resistant tube** if lasering in airway
		* Non-flammable window coverings
		* All non-reflective materials should be tested or rated for laser safety  
		Black colour does not imply a low reflectivity.
		* Drape non-targeted tissues in wet towels
		* Remove oxygen from target site
	* Controlled access  
		* Identification of the room  
		Signage at entries to the room.
			* Protective eyewear should be available at all entries and exits
		* All doors closed
		* All doors unlocked
	* Smoke management
		* Active capture of plume
		* Use of ultra low particulate air filters  
		Required for viruses.
		* Use of protective face masks  
		Usually costly and largely ineffective due to efficiency and efficacy of the sieve. 
	* Active control of laser
		* Always attended whilst on
	* Water  
	Available to douse fire, and team trained in its use.


### Airway Safety

If lasering in the airway:

* Use a laser safe tube
	* Fill cuffs with saline
	* Silicone tubes produces a powdery silica ash
	* PVC are flammable and produce hydrogen chloride and phosgene, which cause chemical pneumonitis
* Keep FiO~2~ â©½30%
* Tube soiling increases risk with Nd:YAG laser
