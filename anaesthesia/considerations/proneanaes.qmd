# Prone Position

The prone position is:

* Required to facilitate certain operations
	* Spinal surgery
	* Posterior fossa craniotomy
	* Certain ankle operations
* Associated with many physiological changes
	* Broadly positive respiratory effects
		* Unchanged lung and chest wall compliance
		* ↑ FRC provided abdomen is not compressed
		* Improved V/Q matching via better distribution of pulmonary blood flow   
		Leads to ↑ in PaO~2~.
	* Broadly negative CVS effects  
	These are predominantly due to abdominal and subsequent IVC compression, and can be reduced by ensuring the abdomen is not compressed.
		* Effects include
			* ↓ preload  
			Associated with ↓ in CI by ~25%.
			* ↑ venous pressure  
			Leads to ↑ bleeding from vertebral wall venous plexuses.
			* ↑ PPV and SVV
		* Effects vary depending on the table being used
			* The **Jackson table** has the least effect on CVS parameters
			* The Wilson table and Andrew's support ↓ CI
			* The jack-knife position leads to ↓ CI, HR, and ↑ MAP
	* ↓ CBF  
	May occur if the head is rotated due to partial occlusion of the ICA, VA; and compression of venous drainage.


## Risks

Risks of prone position include:

* **Blindness**  
Risk of~1:60,000, or 1:30,000 in spinal surgery. Via two mechanisms:
	* Direct pressure on the globe  
	Lead to retinal artery occlusion.
	* Impaired ocular perfusion  
	Mechanism of blindness in absence of ocular pressure (e.g. use of Mayfield clamp).
		* $$Ocular \ Perfusion \ Pressure = MAP - IOP$$  
		A **MAP target >70mmHg** is reasonable to preserve ocular perfusion during anaesthesia.
			* IOP will ↑ with:
				* Venous occlusion
				* Rise in CVP
				* Head-down position
		* Key factors:
			* Lengthy (>6 hour) operation
			* Blood loss >1L
			* Atherosclerosis
			* DM
			* HTN
			* Male
		* Notable factors *not* associated with blindness:
			* Glaucoma
			* Intraoperative blood pressure management
			* Anaemia
			* Hypothermia
			* Anaesthetic technique
	* Corneal abrasion
* Neuropathy  
Via compression or stretching of superficial nerves.
	* Risk is reduced with careful positioning
* Pressure injury
	* Directly, via pressure on:
		* **Vocal cords**
		* Forehead
		* Nose
		* Chest
		* Arms
		* Superior iliac crests
		* Knees
		* Feet
	* Indirectly, via compression of arterial supply or venous drainage:
		* Intraoral swelling
		May lead to airway obstruction and delayed extubation, attributed to excessive neck flexion.
		* Hepatic and pancreatic infarction 
		Attributed to visceral ischaemia.
		* Lower limbs  
		At risk of compartment syndrome when 'tucked'; i.e. with hip and knee flexion.



## Technique

Can be divided into:

* [Assessment](#pre)
* [Preparation](#prep)
* [Induction](#ind)
* [Positioning](#pos)
* [Emergence](#emergence)
* [Emergency Management](#emrx)


### Preoperative Assessment{#pre}

* Consent  
Must cover risk of blindness.
* Position required by surgeons
* Length of procedure
* C-spine assessment  
Will complicate airway management.
* Limb mobility  
Will affect intra-operative positioning.
* Peripheral neuropathy
	* Risk factors
	* Severity of pre-existing disease


### Preparation{#prep}

* Avoid the ACF for venous access
* Place ECG electrodes on the back
* Ensure the correct operating table is available


### Induction{#ind}

* Secure the airway
	* Consider use a reinforced ETT with a bite block  
	Less likely to become kinked during position changes.
	* Secure the ETT well with tape  
	Ties may occlude venous drainage.
	* Recommend against using an LMA  
	Difficult to access the airway if airway difficulties remove.
* Protect the eyes
	* Tape shut
	* Place extra protective padding over the lids  
	Tape the padding in.


### Positioning{#pos}

* Summon a team of at least 5 trained people, including the surgeon
* Disconnect the ETT
* Slowly turn the patient onto the operating table
* Use a foam head holder to support the patients head
* Reconnect the ETT and complete an intraoperative cross-check
	* A sustained or ↑ a Pip >5cmH~2~O should prompt review for endobronchial intubation or bronchospasm
* Assess the pressure areas and position
	* Ensure that the **eyes** are free of pressure  
	Use a mirror to confirm the eyes are not compressed.
	* Ensure **spine** is not excessively flexed or extended  
	Common cause of injury.
	* Ensure **abdomen** is not compressed  
	Will lead to pressure injury, abdominal organ compression with potential intra-abdominal hypertension, and impair respiratory excursion.
	* Ensure that **axilla** are not under tension  
	May lead to brachial plexus palsy.
	* Check other pressure points
	* Place padding liberally on potential pressure areas and bony prominences
	* Ensure **lines and cables** are not compressed into patient  
	e.g. IV/arterial lines, ECG cables, SpO~2~ cable, IDC, NGT.


### Emergence{#emergence}

* Maintain anaesthesia until the patient is repositioned supine
* Check for a cuff leak prior to extubation


## Emergency Management{#emrx}

**Accidental Extubation**:

* Should be anticipated and prepared for
* Ensure the airway is secure and patent after turning, and prior to removing the bed from the operating theatre
* Ensure the ETT and breathing circuit is secured and not hanging freely

* LMA is the **first-choice** for airway rescue  
87.5% first-pass and 100% second-pass success.
	* Once placed, a decision can be made to continue the case using the LMA or to replace with an ETT  
	The LMA can be used as a conduit to replace the ETT over a fibrescope in the prone position.
* Fibreoptic intubation in the prone position can also be performed
	* Anatomically favourable as the tongue falls forwards
	* Requires the head to be accessible


**Cardiac arrest**:

* Chest compressions can be performed  
Place hands over each scapula.
* Defibrillation be performed in the prone position  
Pads can be placed posterolaterally under each axilla.
* If in Mayfield clamp  
Remove mayfield clamp for cardiac compressions and CPR.
