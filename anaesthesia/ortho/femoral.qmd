# Femoral Fracture Surgery

>Airway: GA/LMA. Neuraxial appropriate.
>Access: 14-16G
>Pain: ++/+++
>Position: Generally supine
>Time: 1-3 hours
>Blood loss: 1-3 units. Consider cell salvage.
>Special: High perioperative risk. Early operation â†’ early mobilisation

Femoral fractures:

* Common in :
	* Elderly due to falls
	* Young patients from trauma
* May be:  
Generally blood loss and operative time increases the more distal 
	* **Subcapital**  
	Through the femoral neck.
		* Significantly less blood loss
		* Easier operative approaches (particularly if non-displaced)
		* *Generally*:
			* **[Require hip replacement](/anaesthesia/ortho/thr.md)** if **displaced**
			* Pins if nondisplaced
	* **Intertrochanteric**  
	Around the trochanters.
		* *Generally* **dynamic hip screw**
	* **Subtrochanteric**  
	Distal to the lesser trochanter.
		* *Generally* **ORIF with plate/screws**
	* **Mid/shaft or distal femur**
		* *Generally*:
			* **Intramedullary nail** for non-displaced/tranverse fractures, or fractures with large fragments  
			May be placed anterograde (proximal to distal) or retrograde depending on the nature of the fracture.
			* **ORIF** for displaced/heavily comminuted fractures
			Substantial blood loss and increased operative time.

## Considerations

* B
	* Respiratory comorbidities
	* Fat embolus  
	Up to 15%.
* C
	* Cardiac comorbidities
	* Prior blood loss into thigh may lead to haemodynamic instability
	* Consider arterial line
* E
	* Presence of other traumatic injuries
	* Frailty
* H
	* Potential for blood loss/transfusion requirement

## Preparation

## Induction

Anaesthetic options include:

* Spinal
* Epidural
* GA

## Intraoperative

Key surgical stages include:

* **Reaming** of femoral medullary bone prior to IM nail placement  
Embolises medullary contents into the pulmonary vasculature.
	* May lead to acute right heart failure or respiratory failure


## Postoperative

Complications include:

* 10% fat embolism
* 5-10% malunion
* Up to 10% infection  
Higher with open fixation.
