# Total Hip Replacement/Arthroplasty


>Airway: GA LMA, ETT appropriate if lateral. Can be performed under spinal. Consider CSE if bilateral.
>Access: 14-16G IVC
>Pain: ++. Epidura, lumbar plexus block, or PCA may be beneficial but are not required
>Position: Supine (anterior/anterolateral approach), lateral (lateral/posterior approach)
>Time: 1-3 hours
>Blood loss: 1-2 units may be lost. G+H required.
>Special: Cementing

Involves replacement of the hip joint with prosthesis. May be:

* Unipolar  
Femoral head replaced.
* Bipolar  
Femoral head and acetabular cup replaced.
* Revision  
↑ operating time and blood loss.
	* May be difficult to extract cemented prostheses
* **Girdlestone**  
Removal of femoral head or prostheses without replacement. Typically for infection or palliation.
* Bilateral  
Sequential replacement of each hip joint. ↑ operative duration limits utility of single-shot spinal.


## Considerations

* Indication  
	* OA  
	Most common indication, often associated with limited exercise tolerance which may mask underlying CVS/respiratory disease.
	* Rheumatoid arthritis  
	Associated pulmonary disease, anaemia, potential difficult airway.


* A
	* ETT reasonable if GA in lateral position
* C
	* Relative hypotension ↓ blood loss
	* Cementing may precipitate profound hypotension/cardiac arrest  
	Particularly in right heart failure.
* D
	* Neuraxial anaesthesia:
		* ↓ PONV
		* ↓ DVT/PE risk
		* ↓ blood loss and bleeding into operative field
		* May ↓ POCD risk
	* Nerve damage
* E
	* Neuromuscular blockade for placement of prosthesis and testing of passive ROM
* H
	* DVT is common post-operatively  
	80% in femoral vein.
	* Major blood loss


## Preparation

* Premedication
	* 1g Paracetamol PO
	* 600mg Gabapentin PO
	* 200mg Celecoxib PO

## Induction

Techniques include:

* [Spinal](/anaesthesia/regional/spinal.md):
	* Block to T10
	* Consider:
		* 2.5-5ml 0.5% heavy bupivacaine
		* 10-25ug fentanyl or 100-200 mcg spinal morphine
* Epidural  
Smoother haemodynamic induction and postoperative analgesia.
	* Remove D2 post-operatively if used
* GA

## Intraoperative

Key intraoperative stage is **cementing**:

* Methylmethacrylate is pressurised into medullary bone to assist in sealing of prosthesis
* This may lead to:
	* Pulmonary embolus
	Fat and cement.
		* Pretreat
	* **Hypotension**  
	Direct vasodilation or pulmonary hypertension secondary to embolus.
		* **Pre-treat** with fluid and vasopressor to optimise right heart function
	* **Hypoxia**  
	Secondary to embolus-related shunt.


### Surgical Stages

* Incision
* Dislocation of the femoral head
* Removal of native femoral head
* Reaming of acetabulum for cup replacement
* Placing of femoral head  
Cemented or cementless.
* Hip relocation
* Closure

## Postoperative

High perioperative morbidity, typically due to comorbidities/frailty in the elderly:

* 50% respiratory failure
* 50% arrhythmia risk
* 50% MI risk
* 50% UTI
* 50% DVT/PE
* Up to 20% infection risk
