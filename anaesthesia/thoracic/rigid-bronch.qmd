# Rigid Bronchoscopy


>Airway: Rigid bronchoscope. Usually ETT afterwards. <br>
>Access: 1x large IV. <br>
>Pain: Minimal. <br>
>Position: Supine, head elevated, neck extended. <br>
>Time: Variable. <br>
>Blood loss: Not usually required. Bleeding causes more issues via airway obstruction. <br>
>Special: Ventilation strategies. <br>


Placement of a rigid bronchoscope into the trachea, which allows passage of instruments and facilitates:

* Visual inspection
* Therapeutic interventions  
Indications include:
	* Obstruction
		* Foreign body
		* Tumour
	* Airway bleeding
	* Diagnosis
		* Biopsy
* Endoluminal therapy:
	* Laser
	* Argon plasma coagulation
	* Debridement
	* Endobronchial stent deployment
* Ventilation  
Via side-holes in the rigid bronchoscope, which facilitate ventilation of the **contra-lateral** lung. 


## Considerations

* A
	* Position  
	Requires extreme ramping to facilitate intubation.
	* Secretion  
	Consider anti-sialogogue.
* B
	* Ventilatory and oxygenation demands  
	Risk increased in patients with:
		* Poor exercise tolerance
		* Respiratory distress
		* PaO~2~ ⩽70mmHg
		* PacO~2~ ⩾45mmHg
* D
	* Volatile vs. TIVA  
	Dependent on ventilatory technique: volatile only achievable with intermittent volume ventilation.
	* TIVA  
	Generally preferred; exact technique used will depend on desire for spontaneous or controlled ventilation.
		* Propofol/remifentanil  
		Post-operative analgesia requirements are usually minimal.
		* Propofol/fentanyl
* H
	* Coagulopathy

## Preparation

## Induction

## Intraoperative


### Ventilation

Strategies include:

* Spontaneous ventilation  
Usually only appropriate **in children**.
	* Spontaneous respiration is ideal in inhaled foreign body cases  
	Prevents distal propagation of the foreign body.
	* Oxygenation may be facilitated with:
		* Continuous nasal oxygen  
		Via suction catheter or nasal ETT in nasopharynx.
		* High-flow humidified oxygen
* Controlled ventilation  
Usually required in adults to facilitate tracheal placement of the bronchoscope. Methods include:
	* Jet (Venturi) Ventilation  
	Most common method, and involves high-pressure oxygen delivered through the side port at the proximal end of the scope.
		* Breaths delivered at 10-20/minute at ⩽50psi  
		Lower rates facilitate passive exhalation via elastic recoil of lung and chest wall.
		* Entrainment of air with oxygen facilitates ventilation and oxygenation
		* Ensure there is an **avenue of escape** for the insufflated air to prevent barotrauma
		* Monitor chest rise to prevent excessive V~T~ and gas trapping
		* May be automatic or manual  
		Higher risk of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum with manual technique.
	* High Frequency Jet Ventilation  
	Automated system giving low V~T~ breaths at a rate of 60-300/min.
		* Motionless operating field
		* Difficult to assess adequacy of ventilation  
		May require repeated blood gas analysis.
		* V~T~ < V~Dead Space~  
		Gas transport mechanisms include laminar flow, longitudinal dispersion, pendelluft, molecular diffusion.
	* Intermittent Volume ventilation  
	Ventilation tubing connected to proximal end of bronchoscope.
		* Ventilation provided via the bronchoscope
		* Leak minimised by occluding:
			* Bronchoscope ports with silastic caps
			* Mouth packed with gauze
		* Occlusion of the mouth and nose may be required to prevent leak
		* Only provides intermittent viewing by the proceduralist
	* Continuous insufflation/Apnoeic oxygenation  
	Continually flow of fresh gas via the side-port. Largely abandoned.


Complications of ventilation:

* Hypercarbia
* Hypoxia
* Hypotension
* Pneumothorax  
Secondary to barotrauma from rigid bronchoscopy.
	* Occurs in ⩽1% of cases

## Emergence

Considerations:

* Intubate following procedure to normalise blood gases
* Extubation associated with violent coughing to clear secretions and blood
* Consider:
	* Remifentanil
	* Lignocaine 1mg/kg IV
	* Early suctioning
	* Humidified O~2~

## Postoperative

Pain usually minimal.
