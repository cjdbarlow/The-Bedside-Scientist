# Pneumonectomy


>Airway: Lung isolation required <br>
>Access: 2x Large IV; arterial line on **lower arm** <br>
>Pain: High, risk of CPSP, strongly consider regional <br>
>Position: Lateral <br>
>Time: 1.5-3 hours <br>
>Blood loss: â©½500ml unless great vessels injured. G+H <br>
>Special: Lung isolation <br>

Intro and technique

## Considerations

* B
	* Lung function  
	Underlying and predicted post-operative pulmonary reserve.
	* Lung isolation
* C
	* Concomitant cardiac disease  
	In particular:
		* **Pulmonary hypertension** or **RV dysfunction**  
		Relative contraindication due to the increase in RV afterload.
* D
	* Analgesia  
	Regional techniques recommended:
		* Epidural
		* Paravertebral
		* Extrapleural catheter

## Preparation

*Ensure preoperative [lung function testing](/anaesthesia/thoracics/thoracic-principles.md#lung) testing has been performed.*



## Induction

## Intraoperative

Fluid management:

* Aim <10ml/kg intraoperatively


### Surgical Stages

* Lung isolation
* Chest entered
* Lung allowed to passively deflate
* Vascular structures usually divided first  
Division of hilar structures may compress the heart and great vessels, leading to:
	* Hypotension
	* Arrhythmia
* Clamps applied  
* Lung resected
* Leak test  
Chest filled with saline and Valsalva performed to identify bubbles.
* ICC placed

## Emergence

## Postoperative

Key considerations:

* Disposition
	* ICU
* Analgesia  
Often regional techniques.
* Chest drain



Complications:

* Arrhythmia
* Pulmonary oedema  
Limit fluids to **20ml/kg** in first postoperative day
* Cardiac herniation
	* Keep drains **off suction**  
	* Nurse **operative site up**
