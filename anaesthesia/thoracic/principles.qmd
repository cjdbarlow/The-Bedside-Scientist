# Principles of Thoracic Anaesthesia


*This covers general considerations for thoracic anaesthesia, with the exception of principles (including management of hypoxia) under [one-lung ventilation](/management/resp/olv.md).*

Key considerations:

* Pre-operative optimisation
	* Smoking cessation
	* Exercise
		* Secretion clearance
	* Optimise lungs
		* Bronchodilators
		* Steroids
		* Antibiotics
	* Secretions
		* Chest physiotherapy
	 	* Spirometry
* Indication
	* Tumour
		* Mass effect\
		Mediastinal mass:
			* Lymphomas\
			Rapidly growing - may cause rapid compression.
			* Germ cell-tumours
			* Thymus
			* Thyroid goitres
		* Metabolic
		* Metastases
		* Medication
	* Bullectomy
	* LVRS
	* Transplant
* Respiratory assessment\
Prediction of post-operative pulmonary function is vital to:

* Confirm suitability\
Stratify to:
	* Curative-intent
	* Defined limits of resection
* Ventilator weaning and post-operative disposition\
Dependent on PPO FEV~1~:
	* ⩾40%\
	Extubate in operating room.
	* 30-40%\
	Consider extubation.
	* ⩽30%\
		* Staged weaning
		* Consider thoracic epidural
* Analgesia plan
	* Use of regional anaesthesia



## Preoperative Assessment{#lung}

Should include:

* Normal history and examination
	* Key comorbidities:
		* Chronic lung disease
		* Smoking history
		* Functional capacity
		* Cardiac comorbidities
	* Acute disease process:
		* Bronchospasm
		* Infection
		* Obstruction.collapse
		* Mass effect
	* Treatment effects
		* Chemotherapy
		* Radiotherapy
* Detailed airway assessment\
Insertion of a DLT is more difficult than SLT.


### Assessment of Pulmonary Function

> * Ability to tolerate:
>	* Resection
>	* [One-lung ventilation](/management/resp/olv.md)
> * Broadly speaking, resection is appropriate if:
>	* FEV~1~ ⩾1.5L for lobectomy
>	* FEV~1~ ⩾2.0L or 80% predicted for pneumonectomy



The "3-legged" stool of respiratory assessment evaluates a patients ability to **tolerate** removal of an **anatomically resectable** lung cancer. Many approaches have been described; institutional practice will vary depending on the availability of more advanced investigations (e.g. CPET) testing. This is one approach:

* Perform **Spirometry**\
FEV~1~ and DLCO are:
	* ⩾60% of predicted\
	Proceed to surgery.
	* <60% of predicted
		* Estimate **predicted postoperative lung function**\
		FEV~1~ and DLCO are:
			* ⩾40% of predicted\
			Proceed to surgery.
			* <40% of predicted\
			Perform **CPET testing**\
				* Not always available, and not always performed
				* As measured by **CPET**, or surrogate
				* VO~2~ max >15mL/kg/min\
				Can proceed to surgery. Most useful predictor of outcome. Indicated by:
					* Stair climb ⩾2 flights
					* 6 minute walk test ⩾610m
					* Exercise SpO~2~ <4%)
				* VO~2~ max
					* ⩾10mL/kg/min\
					*May*, in certain circumstances, proceed to surgery.
					* <10mL/kg/min\
					Discuss alternatives.



### Predicted Post-Operative Function Estimation

Predicting post-operative function:

* Estimates the proportion of lung function lost by resection
	* Assumes that all lung segments contribute equally to function\
	Usually not the case as diseased units will inherently perform less well.
* Performed for both FEV~1~ and DLCO\
Calculated as $$PPO FEV_1 = Preoperative \ FEV_1 \times {Number \ of \ segments \ initially - Number \ of segments \ resected \over Number \ of \ segments \ initially}$$
	* Normal is **19 segments**


### Risk Stratification

Elevated risk seen with:

* Abnormal blood gases\
Historically used, but convey ↑ risk if:
	* PaO~2~ >60mmHg
	* PaCO~2~ <45mmHg
* VO~2~max <15mL/kg/min have very high morbidity and mortality
	* VO~2~max >20mL/kg/min have few respiratory complications
