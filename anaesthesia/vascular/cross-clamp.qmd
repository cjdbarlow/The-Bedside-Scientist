# Aortic Cross-Clamp


Dramatic physiological changes occur following clamping of the descending aorta:

* Exact haemodynamic responses vary depending on the level
	* Supra-coeliac clamping consistently redirects blood flow and has predictable responses  
	Requires a potent vasodilator; e.g. GTN or SNP.
		* Compliant splanchnic circulation collapses and drains its large blood resevoir into the central circulation, greatly increasing preload
	* Infra-coeliac clamping is inconsistent, but less dramatic  
	Usually will **not** require vasoactives.
		* Complaint splanchnic circulation buffers the blood drained from the non-compliant renal circulation

## Physiology of Clamping

Immediate effects:

* ↑ Afterload
	* ↑ Systemic BP  
	By 7-10%.
	* May precipitate LV failure
	* Have a profound afterload-reducing agent available 
	**GTN**, **SNP**, **nicardipine**.
* ↑ Preload  
Due to redistribution in blood volume:
	* ↓ Venous capacitance distal to clamp  
	Ejection of blood from splanchnic beds.
	* ↑ Venous capacitance proximal to clamp
		* ↑ CVP
		* ↑ PCWP
		* ↑ LVEDP
* Contractility  
Effect varies depending on **capacity to ↑ coronary flow** in the setting of ↑ O~2~ demand:
	* Adequate coronary supply  
	↑ Contractility as a response to ↑ in preload and afterload.  
		* CO may increase 10-30%.
	* Inadequate coronary supply  
	Diastolic dysfunction, ↑↑ LVEDP, ↓ CO.
* ↑ Myocardial oxygen consumption  


Short-term effects:

* Myocardial ischaemia  
Will occur if the increase in LVEDP exceeds the rise in aortic root pressure.
* ↓ Global oxygen consumption  
Both distal and proximal to clamp.
	* ↑ MV PO~2~
* ↓ Spinal perfusion pressure  
Due to combination of:
	* ↓ Spinal blood flow
	* ↑ CSF pressure
* ↑ Catecholamines
* ↑ Renin and angiotensin
* ↓↓ Renal blood flow
	* ↓ GFR
	* ↓ UO
	* Ischaemia-reperfusion injury  
	Subsequent AKI.
	* **0.25mg/kg of mannitol** is often given to maintain urine output, without much evidence


Long term effects:

* ↑ SVR  
Continues to ↑ with ↑ duration of cross-clamping.


### Preparing for Clamping

Peri-clamping:

* Have potent vasodilator available
* Start vasodilator as the surgeon is placing the clamp  
Clamp is placed slowly to avoid aortic dissection.
* Aim **SBP ~90mmHg**


Post-clamping:

* Wean vasodilator as able


## Aortic Unclamping

Immediate effects:

* ↑ ETCO~2~  
Due to ischaemic washout.
	* **Minimise washout** by **unclamping each lower limb separately**
	* Also present:
		* Lactate
		* NO
* ↓ BP  
May be profound.
	* Due to: 
		* ↓ SVR by 70-80%  
		Distal circulation is profoundly vasodilated due to ischaemia.
		* Relatively volume deplete venous bed
* ↓ Preload  
Due to:
	* Central hypovolaemia  
	Blood pooling into re-perfused tissues.
	* Venodilation  
	Secondary to hypoxia.
* CO  
May ↓, ↑, or remain unchanged depending on relative effect of:
	* ↓ SVR
	* ↓ Preload
	* Ischaemic washout  
	Generally ↓ inotropy.
* Acidosis  
Lactic acidosis due to re-perfusion of ischaemic tissues.


Short-term effects:

* ↑ Renin and angiotensin release


Long-term effects:

* Persistent ↓ GFR and RBF  
May remain ↓ for up to 6 months post-operatively.


### Preparation For Unclamping

Preload:

* Give **volume** targeting **slightly elevated filling pressures** prior to release.
	* **Vasodilators** given **prior to release** allow **extra volume without increasing filling pressures**  
	Cease 5-10 minutes prior to unclamping.


Contractility:

* CaCl~2~
	* Inotropy
	* Myocardial membrane stability  
	In preparation for hyperkalaemic washout.
	* Blood product calcium chelation
* NaHCO~3~  
In preparation for acidosis.
* Adrenaline  
Consider:
	* Adrenaline infusion
	* 10μg/ml push-dose available

### Instability After Unclamping

Hypotension:

* Have the surgeon **reapply the clamp**
* Give more volume
* Consider unclamping strategies  
Limits degree of reperfusion:
	* Partial unclamping  
	* Partial reclamping  
	May be done for bleeding control as well.
	* Staged unclamping  
	Selective reperfusion of different areas.
	* Slow unclamping
