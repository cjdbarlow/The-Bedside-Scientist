# Cell Salvage


Cell salvage involves:

* Collecting blood from the surgical field\
Low-pressure to avoid haemolysis. **Citrate is added immediately** to prevent coagulation.
	* Continuous
	* Intermittent
* Washing and filtering blood\
Removal of contaminants.
* Separation\
Centrifuge of red cells.
* Reinfusion\
Salvaged, citrated blood is collected in a bag, stored at room temperatures, and must be reinfused within 4 hours.


## Indications

Relative indications:

* Significant blood loss
	* Cardiac surgery
	* Vascular surgery
* Rare blood groups/auto-antibodies
* Religious groups with objections to transfusion\
May not be acceptable to all.
* Reduced blood bank access


## Advantages

* Reduces transfusion by up to 40%
	* Cost
	* Transfusion reactions
* Higher 2,3-DPG than allogenic blood


## Disadvantages

* Cost
	* Initial cost is expensive, value will depend on use frequency
* Haemolysis
* Absence of coagulation factors\
May lead to dilutional coagulopathy.
* Embolism
	* Air
	* Fat
	* Microaggregates
* Salvaged blood syndrome\
* Citrate load\
Calcium required to reverse.
* TACO
* Hypotension\
Due to bradykinin from leukodepletion filters.


### Special Circumstances

Controversy remains around:

* Malignancy\
Concern about reinfusion of tumour cells, but no evidence of this.
* Contamination\
Potential for bacteraemia if salvage from contaminated site; use is not recommended.
* Obstetrics\
Risk of:
	* AFE\
	No evidence, but double suction used with the non-amniotic suction used to remove amnion.
	* Rhesus sensitisation\
	From foetal blood; mitigate with giving mother anti-D.
