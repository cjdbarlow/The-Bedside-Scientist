Change of burns dressings is:

* Performed regularly
* Exquisitely painful
* Often performed out of the operating room if debridement is not required

## Considerations

* A
	* Aspiration risk
* B
	* Hypoxia risk under sedation
* D
	* Analgesic requirements
	* Desire of surgical team to wean sedation requirements
* E
	* Extent of burn/time required for dressing change

## Process

One approach:

* Induction:
	* 0.5-1mg/kg IV ketamine  
	Higher if stimulating.
		* Heavy ketamine use reduces risk of airway obstruction and apnoea
	* 0.05-0.1mg/kg IV oxycodone
* Maintenance
	* Propofol TCI at 1-2ug/ml
	* Consider additional 0.5mg/kg IV ketamine if the procedure is prolonged/stimulating
* Emergence
	* Consider further 0.05mg/kg oxycodone for post-operative analgesia
