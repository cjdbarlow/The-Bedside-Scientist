ECT involves transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the brain to produce generalised seizures in order to treat certain psychiatric disorders. ECT is:

* Used to treat severe depression, mania, and catatonia
* Performed regularly (e.g. twice weekly) for 3-4 weeks, and then usually ceased\
Dosing and issues can be reliably deduced from reviewing old anaesthetic charts.
* Associated with a **significant physiological response**
	* Arrhythmias and MI are the primary cause of ECT-related mortality
	* Initial parasympathetic discharge associated with electrical stimulus\
	Bradycardia or, rarely, asystole may occur.
	* Subsequent dominant sympathetic response\
	Large ↑ in SBP, moderate ↑ in HR, tachyarrhythmias.




## Preoperative

**Assessment:**
* CVS Comorbidities
	* Recent MI\
	Absolute contraindication if ⩽3 months.
	* Recent aortic aneurysm, angina, CHF, thrombophlebitis.\
	Relative contraindications.
	* Presence of PPM\
	Magnet should be available.
* Underlying psychiatric illness



## Intraoperative

> Usually can be performed with brief sedation and sub-intubating dose muscle relaxation without a secured airway, e.g.:

**Preparation:**
* Standard ANZCA monitoring
* IV access


**Induction:**
* Preoxygenation
* Induction with propofol (1-2mg/kg)
* Partial relaxation with suxamethonium (e.g. 0.6-1mg/kg)\
Adequate muscle relaxation is essential to prevent
	* Teeth damage from masseter spasm\
	Most common injury.
	* Muscular damage or fractures from seizures.
* Assisted mask ventilation may be required until spontaneous ventilation resumes
* Insertion of **bite block**


**Maintenance:**
* Labetalol or esmolol may be required for treatment of hypertension
* Atropine may be required for treatment of bradycardia


**Emergence:**
* Altered mental status\
Non-memory cognitive functions are rarely affected, however common side-effects include:
	* Confusion
	* Agitation
	* Violent behaviour
	* Amnesia
	* Headache
	* Myalgia
	* Nausea and vomiting
* Amnesia\
Period of anterograde and retrograde amnesia around seizure. Rarely may become prolonged with long durations of ECT treatment.

## Postoperative

**Destination:**
* Recovery management important in off-the-floor areas


**Specific:**
* Postictal headache\
Due to dilation of meningeal vessels.
* Haemodynamic upset\
May last minutes to over an hour post-procedure:
