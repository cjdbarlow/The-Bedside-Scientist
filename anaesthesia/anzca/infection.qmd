# Guidelines on Infection Control in Anaesthesia


Definitions:

* **Asepsis**\
Prevention of microbial contamination of living tissues or sterile materials.
* **Disinfection**\
Inactivation of non-sporing organisms with thermal or chemical means.
* **Sterilisation**\
Complete destruction of all microorganisms, including spores.

Equipment classifications:

* **Critical**\
Penetrate skin or mucous membranes, or enters a sterile space. Requires sterilisation.
* **Semi-critical**\
In contact with intact mucous membranes or becomes contaminated with readily transmissible organisms. Requires sterilisation or high level disinfection.
* **Non-critical**\
Contacts skin or does not contact the patient. Requires a low-level of disinfection or cleaning.

## Infection Prevention

Precautions:

* Standard precautions\
Gloves, eyewear, gowns, or aprons.
* Gloves\
	* When anticipated contact with body fluids
	* Changed after moving from a contaminated to a non-contaminated body site
* Masks\
When performing a sterile procedure under full aseptic conditions.
* Overshoes
	* Not required if theatre shoes in use
	* Should be worn if shoes are contaminated
	* Hand hygiene should be performed after removing them

Behaviours:

* Hand hygiene\
* Theatre traffic\
Should be minimised, and theatre doors should be closed.
* Sharps\
Should be:
	* Disposed of immediately after use
	* Not re-sheathed, bent, broken, or manipulated

Active management:

* Antibiotics
* Maintain normothermia
* Restrictive transfusion strategy
* Vaccinations


## Anaesthetic Equipment

Airway equipment:

* Masks\
Semi-critical.
* Laryngoscopes\
Critical, require sterilisation.
* Bronchoscopes\
Semi-critical.
* Bougies\
Single-use preferred.


Anaesthetic breathing systems:

* Circuits\
Can be used for multiple cases provided an HME is in place.
* Breathing bag\
Cleaned between each use.
* Sampling lines\
	* Gas should pass through a viral filter
	* Can be reused
* Surfaces and monitors\
Cleaned with detergent and water between patients.

Ultrasound:

* Surface probes
	* Removal of gel and debris
	* Wiped with detergent cloth
	* Disinfected
* Internal probes\
Semi-critical.

## Invasive Procedures

Require aseptic technique:

* Cannulation
	* Hand hygeine
	* Gloves
	* Skin disinfectant\
	Alcohol only suitable for cannulation â©½24 hours.
* Central venous cannulation
	* Aseptic technique
	* Maximal barrier precautions\
		* Full body draping
		* Hat, mask, gown, sterile gloves
	* 0.5-2% chlorhexidine skin preparation\
	Tincture of iodine, or 70% alcohol are appropriate if chlorhexidine is contraindicated.

## Drugs

Contamination can be minimised by:

* Using one ampoule only for one patient
* Using filter needs when appropriate
* Wiping rubber stopper of vial with disinfectant prior to aspirating contents
