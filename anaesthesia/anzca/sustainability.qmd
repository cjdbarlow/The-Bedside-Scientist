# Environmental Sustainability


Climate change has:

* A significant impact on health outcomes
* Partially resulted from healthcare  
	* **7%** of **Australian CO<sub>2</sub> emissions** are from **healthcare**
	* **5%** of **hospital CO<sub>2</sub> emissions** are from **anaesthesia**



## Personal Responses

Clinical:

* Inhalational anaesthetic agents  
Have significant and sustained environmental impact. Consider:
	* Avoiding desflurane and nitrous oxide
	* Use low-flows
	* Minimise use of inhalational agents when clinically permissible
		* TIVA
		* Regional
* Needles and non-tempered glass medications only in sharps bins
* Rational use of diagnostic tests


Non-clinical:

* Reduce unnecessary travel
* Advocacy
* Research into environmental effects


## Hospital Responses

Infrastructure:

* Heating and cooling considerations
	* Occupancy-sensing
* Water use
	* Auto-off taps	
* Power generation


### Operating Theatre Responses

> * Theatres generate 20-25% of hospital waste
> * 60% of theatre waste is recyclable

Reusable equipment:

* Surgical gowns
* Surgical hats
* Anaesthesia equipment
	* Laryngoscopes
	* LMAs
	* Masks
	* Circuits

Other:

* Reform prefabricated kits to only contain what is necessary
* Avoid unnecessary use of drugs
