# Rapid Sequence Induction


Rapid Sequence Induction is:

* Classically described as using thiopentone and suxamethonium (given immediately after thiopentone and prior to loss of consciousness), in combination with cricoid pressure, to allow rapid placement of a cuffed ETT in the trachea and therefore minimise the risk of aspiration
* Often 'modified' by changing any of these factors:  
	* Adjusting drug choice or dosing interval
	* Ventilating the patient during the apnoeic period
	* Avoiding cricoid pressure

## Choice of Drug



## Ventilation

* Ventilation during the apnoeic period:
	* May lead to gastric insufflation, and subsequent aspiration
	* Prolongs time to desaturation  
	Useful in:
		* Poor reserve
		* Sepsis
		* Hypermetabolic states
		* Indicating ease of face-mask ventilation
	* Allows ventilation and reduces respiratory acidosis

## Cricoid Pressure

Cricoid pressure is:

* Pressure of 30N applied to the cricoid cartiledge during the period of loss of consciousness and confirmation of (cuffed) tracheal intubation
* Theorised to compress the oesophagus and therefore reduce gastric aspiration  
Evidence (both for and against cricoid pressure) is weak. Cricoid pressure:
	* *May* reduce the risk of aspiration  
	Evidence is poor.
		* Studies demonstrating reduced aspiration risk are small and poor quality
		* Ultrasound and MRI studies suggest that applying cricoid laterally displaces rather than compresses the oesophagus
		* NAP4 noted several cases where cricoid was omitted during RSI despite strong indications, and significant morbidity/mortality from aspiration resulted  
		Conversely, there were no major complications identified in cases where cricoid pressure was applied.
	* May *increase* risk of aspiration by reducing oeosophageal sphincter tone
	* *Does* reduce gastric distension during face-mask ventilation
	* May worsen laryngoscopic view
		* Cricoid pressure should be **released immediately if view is difficult**  
		Release under direct vision with suction immediately available.
	* May increase difficulty of supraglotic airway placement
	* Requires a skilled airway assistant
