> Facts that are useful but don't fit cleanly into a current section


>* Trauma is more of a political specialty than a medical one
>* "You can be shot by accident but its hard to be stabbed by mistake."


Causes of death:

* Exsanguination
* Airway obstruction
* Tension PTHx
* Pump failure

Major trauma is defined as:

* Death after injury
* ICU admission for >24 hours and requiring mechanical ventilation
* Serious injury to 2 or more body systems
* An ISS >12
* Urgent surgery for:
	* Intracranial
	* Intrathoracic
	* Intraabdominal
	* Fixation of pelvic and spinal injuries


* Endocrine crises depend on the underlying condition (e.g. hypothyroidism) and a physiological stress (surgery, illness) that exacerbates that condition


* AF is a disease of disorganised conduction  
Does not relate to the presence or absence of P waves; but its relationship to the QRS.
	* Degree of atrial activity is often seen, especially in V~1~
	* Difficult to convert to sinus but easy to rate control

AF Mx:

* Find cause
	* Ischaemia
	* CM
	* Infection
	* Anaemia
	* TFTs
* Fix
* Control rate  
Rate control better as less strokes than rhythm control (on warfarin, different now?).
	* Rhythm control good for sick patients who need the atrial kick
* Anticoagulate

* AFlutter
	* Very shockable

* RBBB in isolation is not associated with RAD because the bulk of depolarisation is still heading to the LV

* Q waves take ~8 hours to occur after infarction
* Q waves should be ~1/3rd of the R wave it proceeds, unless infarction is occurring


* ST elevation in III > II with ST elevation in aVL suggests RCA lesion
* ST elevation in II > II with ST elevation in aVL suggests LCx lesion


* J point is 60-80ms from the deepest part of the S wave


* Upward deflections in V1~1~ are (almost) always pathological
	* RVH  
	PHTN, PE.
	* RV infarct
	* Lead placement
	* Dextrocardia
	* RBBB
	* WPW

* QRS duration is the speed of conduction through the myocardium  
Quantifies, to a degree, the ejection fraction.
	* Short QRS; rapid & efficient conduction -> probable good ejection
	* Prolonged QRS; slow conduction -> potentially bad conduction  


* LBBB should be evaluated pre-operatively some way, especially if new, and even if asymptomatic


* Perioperative cardiac function:
	* LV function
	* Exercise tolerance


* RVOT VT spreads towards cardiac apex; has LBBB morphology  
May be able to be managed medically.
* VT with RBBB; LV source (usually myocardial scar from infarct)


* CHB risk is related to escape rhythm
	* Junctional escape suggests purkinje system intact and is relatively less urgent  
	But should be done before anaesthesia.
	* Ventricular escape suggests need for pacing


* WPW
	* Pre-excitation = short PR interval
	* Delta wave = slurring in first 50% of QRS
	* Usually okay if not in AF  
	In AF, its like having VF - unfiltered pathway conducts all the atrial activity through to the ventricle.
	* Requires class I drugs or DCC


EEG in ICU:

* Monitor burst suppression
* Diagnosis undifferentiated conscious impairment
* Diagnose NCSE
* Prognosticate hypoxic brain injury
* Early diagnosis vasospasm


Mannitol contraindications:

* Na >150
* Osm >320


Easy epilepsy loading doses:

* Phenytoin 20mg/kg
* Valproate 40mg/kg
* Levetiracetam 60mg/kg


PRBC transfusion incrementsS:

* 4ml/kg ↑ Hb by ~10g/L


## Midface Fractures
* Airway control important
* Blood major issue
* Laryngoscopy usually straightforward
* Then realign face
* Usually interventional radiology in first instance
* Bite blocks and splints
* Then surgery in a few days when swelling has improved


## Impact Brain Apnoea

## Cryoprecipitate & Transfusion
* 10-250mg fibrinogen in each bag  
Median 150mg.
* Give calcium every second unit of blood

## PRBC
Physiology:

* pH 6.5
* K ⩾25mmol/L


## TEG/ROTEM
* Point of care viscoelastic test for measurement of coagulation function

## Cyclical Hyper-resuscitation


## Visceral Organ Injury
* Bradycardia/lack of tachycardiac due to vagal stimulation despite inadequate organ confusion


## End-Points of Resuscitation
Values indicating critical physiological derangement include:

* Temperature ⩽35
* pH ⩾7.2
* Ionised Calcium ⩽1
* Plt ⩾50
* INR ⩾1.5
* APTT
* Fibrinogen level ⩽1



## Blood Resuscitation
Paeds: 10ml/kg of all blood product is a good guide


# Posterior fossa craniectomy
Posterior fossa craniectomy have more VAE than supine
Not much room for surgical operation
Haemodynamic instability from manipulating brainstem cardiac centres
Obstructive hydrocephalus



## Awake crani
* Patient selection, counselling
* art line and IV on ipsilateral side
* Empty bladder
* Warming blanket
* TEDS, no calf compressors
* Intra-operative awake/asleep/awake

## Coiling
Coiling:

* Remote
* Radiation
* Radiology equipment
* Heparin requirement



# Aortic stenosis echo
* Echo pressure measurements are based on velocity, cath lab based pressure measurements are based on actual pressure
* Peak velocity is based on the maximal pressure gradient, which does not occur at peak aortic pressure but on the actual upstroke of the LV
* Echo tables therefore will overestimate the degree of stenosis compared to cath lab measurements

## Mitral valve
* Anterior leaflet ~1/3 of anulus
* Posterior leaflet ~2/3 of annulus
* Omniplane:
	* 0 deg cuts A2 P2
	* 60deg cuts along commissure and gives the P3, A2, P1 view
	* 90deg cuts through A2 P3
	* 150deg cuts through P2 A2 again


## Cardioplegia
* Various types


# PDU
* Bloomfield: Leadership is an invitation to collective action
* Need to explain why - then people will work out how

Falter
* ↑ aortic dissection rate during 1st covid wave, no pathyophysiological difference
* Give 30% of predicted protamine dose to reverse CPB to ECMO

Bellomo:

* ATII effective for vasodilatory shock if renin levels remain low

Ventriculoarterial coupling: Systole pressure energy conveted to elastic energy

## Radiopaedia note:

* L LL sits at base of heart down to diaphragm
* Lingula touches left heart border
* RML covers R heart border

## Anatomy of a bypass circuit



## Systemic review
* Clearly stated set of objectives with pre-defined eligibility criteria
* Explicit and reproducible methodology


# Meta analysis
* Combined results of several studies with values weighted by various quality criteria
* Funnel plot: is my study representative

## RCTs
* Obtain two similar groups, treated identically, except for intervention vs control
* Followed up identically
* Statistical difference on a predefined outcome which is clinically relevant
* Use CONSORT criteria when interpreting studies  
* 5 major questions:
	* Should this study have been performed?
		* Originality
		* Incremental
		* Significance
	* Is the methodology flawed?

## Bias
* Selection
* Performance  
Difference in care outside of the intervention.
* Detection
* Attrition
* Reporting

## Odds and risk
* RR is a ratio of rates, and expresses comparative likelihoods of events between populations
* OR is a ratio of odds, looking at relative likelihoods of events given EXPOSURES

## Post resuscitation care
CO2; aim 50-55
O2: aim low normal
Temp: 33 to 36 degrees
SBP >100
Control glucose


## Ventilation strategy
* PEEP 14-16 well tolerated and seems greatest bang for buck with damaged lung
* Automated recruitment on GE machines
* Benefit seen in ARDSnet but reversed in ROSE; probably because ventilator dyssynchrony reduced with better ventilators and ventilation modes
* PCV maximises driving pressure throughout the entire breath
	* Alveoli peak early due to high pressure gradient in proximal airway
	* Higher initial flow
	* More of Vt delivered early in inspiratory cycle
	* Vt better distributed among alveoli with different time constants


## Hyponatraemia & friends
John Reeves talk:

* Diagnose based on osmoles
* Treat based on volume
* Urinary sodium is a function of the bodies impression of its volume state
* Hiller Am J Med 1999 correcting sodium; rule of thumb; for every 3mmol/L ↑ in BSL the sodium will fall by 1  
Corrected sodium useful to assess total volume deficit; e.g. in DKA, look at difference between corrected sodium and normal sodium, normal sodium deficit.
* Acute kidney injuries, the urea and creatinine rise proportionally
* Chronic kidney failure, the creatinine rises disproportionately to the urea
* Random conditions, the urea will rise disproportionately to the creatinine
	* Water depletion
	* GI haemorrhage
	* Catabolism
	* Pulse steroids

Liver function:

* INR best index of rapid progression
* Albumin and globulins indicators of synthetic function
* ALP and GGT indicate duct damage
* Transaminases detect hepatocyte damage


* HCO3 should move 2mmol/L for each 10mmHg change in CO2


## Ethics
Ethical practice:

* Autonomy  
Right to make own decisions. Advanced care directive is to defend autonomy when they no longer have capacity.
	* Opposite is paternalism  
	Any restriction of a patients autonomy, motivated or presented as being justified by interest in the patients well-being.
* Beneficence  
The duty to do the best for the patient.
	* Duty to do good
	* Difficult to decide what is best?  
	Patient, doctor, hospital administration, etc.
* Non-maleficence  
Duty to do no harm.
	* Doctrine of double effect  
	Intended good effect morally outweighs negative effects, provided that negative effect is not intended, even if it is foreseen. 
		* The action itself must be morally indifferent or morally good
		* The bad effect must not be the means by which the good effect is achieved
		* The motive must be the achievement of the good effect
		* The good effect must be at least equivalent in importance to the bad effet
	* Can be tested with the **Sulmasy test**  
	e.g. IN palliative care; if the patient did not die as a result of my actions, would I feel I achieved what I set out to do? If no, then okay.
* Justice
	* Distribute justice  
	Fair distribution of scarce resources. Many ways to define fair:
		* Equal share
		* By need
		* By effort
		* By contribution
		* By merit
		* By free-market exchanges
	* Rights based justice  
	Respect for peoples rights.
* Fidelity  
Act in ways that are loyal.
	* Role fidelity  
	Act appropriately to your job.
* Utility  
Greatest good for greatest number.

# FOI Speel
I would thoroughly explain the process to the patient, that it may take some time, and the possibility of discomfort.

I would gain IV access, and give 200-400ug of glycopyrrolate IV as an antisialagogue. I would apply nasal prong oxygen and commence remifentanil TCI at 1ng/ml, titrating to patient comfort whilst ensuring they remain spontaneously ventilating.

For nasal FOI, I would:

* Identify the most patent nostril
* Ensure I am not using more than 9mg/kg lignocaine total
* Spray the nostril with 1-3 sprays of cophenylcaine
* Serially dilate with NPAs
	* From a small size up to 0.5 size above the intended tube size
	* Using lignocaine 2% viscous gel on the first NPA
	* Using copious lubricant on the other NPAs
* Whilst dilating, I would spray 10% lignocaine via MAD over 5 minutes, targeting the:
	* Oropharynx
	* Tonsillar pillars
	* Base of tongue
* Load Parker Flex tube onto the bronch
* Use ETT as an introducer for bronchoscope into nasopharynx
* Advance bronchoscope into oropharynx and identify glottis
* Use 2% lignocaine spray-as-I-go to anaesthetise larynx
* Spray into trachea to anaesthetise carina
* Advance bronchoscope to carina
* Advance tube over bronchoscope
* Secure airway and confirm ventilation with CO2 monitoring
* Commence anaesthesia

## Metaanalysis
i-squared: Percentage of variability  	


## Exam Stuff
Overall:

* Impossible to completely prepare
* Odds are in your favour
* Likely that blue book won't cover MCQs but may cover vivas
	* Blue book 2017 will be about right though...

MCQ and SAQ:

* **ANZCA networks high yield**
	* Anaesthesia learning module?
* Review questions and vivas over the last 2 years; highly likely MCQs and SAQs will relate to these topics
* One examiner marks each question  
Random double-marker.
	* Illegibility, spelling errors are penalised by examiner frustration
* Questions aimed to be answered in ~8 minutes
	* Generally easy to get the main points
	* Time management important
	* Low yield after the main points
* Recent questions from FRCA and CICM good for vogue topics

Med viva:

* Should mostly be chronic stable disease
* Rarely acute
* Almost never a DDx
* Patients tend to be institionalised and pretty good historians
* Scoring systems (NYHA etc) are good, but if not applicable to your disease then score based on their functional impact
* Sometimes a bit chaotic on day due to nature of patients, so less standardised than usual
* Want an organised, empathic, listening approach to patient and getting information relevant to you as an anaesthetist
* Respect and rapport with the patient is vital and "you will be punished severely" if you cause pain or are not respectful
* Wear suit and tie or equivalent
* Stem on door will direct you to a system; focus on that system first and then and only then go outside of that system if it is relevant and you have time
* In general questions shouldn't focus on perioperative issues, but that may happen with weird shit because they don't know what else to talk about
* Investigations are a big part of this exam
	* More detail on spirometry including MMEF, peak and end expiratory flow, shape of waveform and why (seem to want more detail than most of the online resources have)
	* Lead with the big stuff up front (e.g. there is a massive anterior STEMI), and then go through the detailed bit -> normally they will cut you off if you got the major things
* Most common mistake is failure to listen to the patient

Trends in people who fail:

* Haven't used ANZCA networks
* Haven't used the taxonomy for SAQs
* Lack of organisation

Vivas:

* Three areas to work through
* Make decision and justify your management
* Avoid diving too deep too soon
* Admit ignorance if complex cases that you haven't done  
"I haven't done this but I am aware of these issues (list), and would seek advice of a senior and experienced colleague"
* Grab lifelines when offered
* Don't dive into crisis mode inappropriately early; demonstrates not ready for independent practice


## TOE
Goal & good at:

* Demonstrate anatomical aspects of valvular pathology
* Provide assurance that surgical technique successful
* Haemodynamic monitoring
* Anatomical monitoring
	* AV, MV, TV
	* Base of heart


Not so good at:

* Visualising
	* PV
	* Apex
* Physiology  
Requires anaesthetic and therefore changes physiology from patients usual loading conditions.
	* Regurgitant lesions appear better due to reduced afterload
	* Aortic stenosis  
	Appear less severe because reduced contractility.
	* Grading severity  
	Good at looking at WHY a lesion exists, once the physiology is graded on TTE.


Demonstrated use:

* When a cardiac chamber is opened:
	* Valve repair
	* Congenital cardiac
	* HOCM
	* Endocarditis
* Dissection
* Unexplained severe hypotension


Maybe used:

* Lung transplant
* Liver transplant
* Major non-cardiac with severe symptomatic haemodynamic response


Diastolic function assessment:

* Grades
	* Normal
	* Grade I/impaired relaxation	
	Relaxing more slowly than normal but no compensatory rise in LAP. Is normal in >65 year olds.
	* Grade II/pseudonormal  
	Slowly relaxing ventricle but some compensation by a moderate rise in LAP.
	* Grade III/restrictive filling  
	Severe relaxation failure accommodated by high LAP and LV remodelling.
	* Grade IV/fixed  
	Severe unfixable relaxation failure
* Measurement
	* Pulse wave doppler through tips of mitral valve leaflets
	* Gives E/A
		* E wave
			* Pressure gradient between LA and LV  
			High with:
				* High LV negative pressure
				* High LA filling pressure
		* A wave
			* Pressure gradient generated by atrial contraction and LV
			* Atria has no valves and is pretty weak so can only generate ~5mmHg of additional pressure
		* Normally, atrial kick is more important and so A usually > E, i.e. E/A <1
		* With deterioration:
			* Grade I: LVEDP ↑, which reduces diastolic filling (smaller E wave) but atrial kick still relatively reasonably decent, and so E/A reversal occurs (A bigger than E)
			* Grade II: LAP (filling) pressures ↑ so gradient is restored. Atria is still a little bitch and so its contribution is relatively small against the ↑ LV DP so E>A. Looks "normal" from a FLOW point of view on echo, but the pressures are higher.
				* Valsalva will reduce LA filling pressures, which will restore "normal" filling pressures and therefore E phase filling is reduced and A>E again. This allows pseudonormal to be differentiated from grade I dysfunction.
			* Grade III: E wave becomes progressively larger as LAP ↑, and A wave becomes smaller because the little bitch atrium can't contract against such high LV pressures.
			* Grade IV:
			* As ventricle gets stiffer, its diastolic filling time reduces because it distends so quickly. E wave duration shortens because the ventricle fills (and stops filling) so quickly.
		* E/E'
			* E': Velocity of submitral myocardium in early diastole; measured at septum and lateral wall (septum usually lower). Indicates how fast the ventricle is relaxing. Related to:
				* How well the LV is relaxing (sucking)
				* How hard the filling pressure is pushing (blowing)
			* E/E' accounts for the blowing portion to better estimate the sucking


Aortic stenosis:

* DI
	* Least assumptions
	* Probably the most accurate, barring issues with CW doppler (e.g. outflow tract obstruction)
* AVA
	* Derived from DI
* MPG  
Can be a function bad AS (high gradient) or bad LV function (low gradient). Compare with DI and stress TTE?


LV function:

* EF
* FS
* GLS
	* Integrated measurement of change in length of myocardium
	* -18 normal, less negative is worse (less movement)



## NIRS
Cerebral oximetry:

* Principles similar to pulse oximetry and spatial resolution
* Algorithmically correct for saturation of extracranial blood
* Values are derived mainly from venous blood and are independent of pulsatile blood flow
* Use
	* Collect baseline prior to induction  
	Usual is 60-80%.
	* Factors affecting oxygenation:
		* Cerebral blood flow
			* CO
			* Acid-base
			* Haemorrhage
			* Arterial inflow/venous outflow
		* Oxygen content
			* [Hb]
			* Hb saturation
			* Lung function
			* FiO2
	* Optimise based on the above factors
	* Reduction of 12-20% from baseline suggests brain ischaemia
* Limitations
	* Extracranial blood saturation
	* Diathermy
	* Only measures regional saturation
	* Don't detect cause

## Blood Gas Corrections
2 and 4 are just as good and easier to remember.
i.e. for every 10 change in CO2, bicarb will chagne acutely by 2 and chronically by  4.

# Problem Statements
## Cardiac tamponade
Primary goals are to avoid haemodynamic collapse and expedite decompression.

### Avoid haemodynamic collapse
- Full, fast, maintain contractility and SVR
- Arterial line
- Volume line available to maintain preload
- Vasopressor infusion to avoid excessive hypotension
- If critical (cannot lie flat): spontaneously ventilating induction to avoid PPV and ↑ in RV afterload, and reduce instability associated with rapid induction

### Minimise surgical time
- Prepped and draped preinduction
- Plan for urgent thoracotomy if arrests

## Severe Pulmonary Hypertension
Greatest risk of anaesthetic mortality. Keys are to accurately assess RV function, optimise perioperatively, defend RV function, avoid raised PVR.

### RV function assessment
- PAP more useful as long-term prognostic indicator than anaesthetic prognostic indicator
- Clinical: Exercise tolerance, peripheral oedema, congestive hepatopathy
- Echo: Systolic function (TAPSE, radial), diastolic dysfn (dilation, RAE)

### Perioperative optimisation
- Fluid state (diuresis to optimal preload)
- Pulmonary vasodilators

### Defend RV
- CVC and transduce; CVP rising -> failing
- Arterial line
- Vasopressor infusion
- Defend RV perfusion pressure
- Consider TOE/PAC

### Avoid raised PVR
- Normoxia
- Avoid hypercarbia
- Optimise FRC and PEEP/avoid atelectasis
- Control pain
- Avoid acidosis
- Avoid hypothermia

## AFOI
Requires adequate time and a compliant patient; key domains are sedation, topicalisation, and technical skill/equipment.

### Sedation
- I prefer judicious sedation with immediately reversible agents
- Requirement ↓ with good patient preparation and expectation management
- 0.25-0.5mg midazolam
- Fentanyl 25ug increments

### Topicalisation
- Antisialagogue with glycopyrrolate 200-400ug
- Lignocaine up to 9mg/kg
- For nasal: 
 - Cophenylcaine to most patent nostril, then serial dilation with lubricated NPAs up to 0.5 intended tube size, using 2% lignocaine viscous gel as lubricant on first NPA.
 - Bulk of remainder of lignocaine via MAD to oropharynx, tonsillar pillars, and base of tongue
 - Spray cords and proximal trachea prior via tube with 2ml 2% in 5ml syringe
- For PO
 - Spray with MAD as above
 - Ensure to move tip down to spray cords (spray with inhale)
 - Test with tip or OPA

### Technical skill
- Position; sitting from front
- Nasal: Easier, bleeding, better tolerated, not as good long term
- Oral: Harder, better for ICU/tube exchange
- Bullet tip tube
- Nasal: Assistant with gauze on tongue, pull forward
- PO: Use Berman or ovassapian to keep scope and tube in midline


## DLT insertion
- Intubate and connect tube
- Confirm tracheal placement with CO2
- Confirm correct side with scope to identify RUL bronchus trifurcation
- Inflate bronchial cuff under vision
- Clamp isolated side and open lumen to air
 - Feel for gas leak from isolated side
 - Check for drop in Vt on vent (PCV)
 - If uncertain or unclear, auscultate and recheck with bronch


## Unsecured Aneurysm
Priorities are to prevent aneurysm rupture by avoiding changes in transmural pressure, avoid ↑ ICP, and manage complications of SAH.

### Transmural pressure
- Avoid swings in MAP and HR
- Gentle induction with remi, props, vasopressor
- Tit
- Key phases include intubation, pinning, bone off, and dura opening


### Avoid ↑ ICP
- Position: Head up, tape not tie
- Ventilation: CO2, PEEP
- Drugs: Sedation, muscle relaxant, osmotic agents

### Complications
- Hydrocephalus
- Arrhythmia
- Vasospasm


## Laryngeal fracture
Critical situation. Principles are to maintain spontaneous ventilation, and secure the airway below the level of the injury

### Spontaneous ventilation
- Avoid PPV

### Secure
- Aim awake surgical trache
- Cric and percutaneous techniques not ideal
- Failing that secure from the top with VAFI; i.e. intubate under direct vision
- Tits up -> RSI and pray

## Severe pre-eclampsia
Key goals are care of mother and care of baby. Priorities are expedite delivery, control BP, seizure prophylaxis, care for baby.

### Expedite delivery
- Urgent C/S
- GA may be required
- Goals of induction are to secure riskier/unfasted airway rapidly whilst avoiding hypertension, recognising the prime killer of these patients is ICH due to hypertensive induction

### Control BP
- Rapid to <160 and slower thereafter
- IV agents: labetalol 2.5-10mg IV, hydralazine 5-10mg
- PO: Nifedipine

### Seizure prophylaxis
- 4g MgSO4/20 min; 1g/hr thereafter for 24/24

### Baby
- CTG
- Paediatricians
- Intrauterine resus PRN


## Myasthenia Gravis
Major concerns are bulbar, respiratory, cardiac, and skeletal muscle; as well as avoiding crises.

## Bulbar
- Aspiration risk

## Respiratory
- Post op respiratory dysfunction
- May need HDU depending on degree of restrictive defect

## Cardiac
- Myositis
- Anterior mediastinal mass (thymomas)

## Skeletal
- Muscle relaxants:
 - Sux resistant
 - Non-depolarising sensitive; use 1/10th of dose, monitor, sugammadex

## Crises
- Cholinergic: Excess ACh leading to parasympathetic (SLUDGE) and weakness. Intubate and give atropine.
- Myasthenic: Weakness due to inadequate ACh, exacerbated by physiological stress. Pyridostigmine.


## Rheumatoid
Concerns relate to:

### Neck mobility

### Extra-articular manifestations
- Respiratory: ILD
- Cardiac: Myopathy

### Immunosuppression from therapy


# Stress Dose Steroids
* Glucocorticoids >5mg/day can cause HPA axis supression
* All glucocorticoid dependent patients are at risk of adrenal crisis due to surgical or physiological stress
* Hydrocortisone 100mg IV bolus
	* Tapering dose if high physiological stress/major surgery/labour
	* Single shot for more minor procedures/bowel prep
* Dexamethasone is inadequate due to lack of mineralocorticoid activity
* Children are more vulnerable
* Risk factors
	* Any comorbidity  
	Any disease ↑ risk.
	* Asthma
	* Diabetes


# Open Disclosure
Open disclosure describes the way clinicians communicate with and support patients, and their family and carers who have experienced harm during healthcare. Open disclosure is:

* A patient right
* Anchored in professional ethics
* Considered good clinical practice
* Part of the continuum of care


Principles:

* Open
* Timely
* Acknowledged to the patient
* Apology
* Support to patient and family
* Support to healthcare providers
* Integrated clinical risk management and systems improvement
* Good governance
* Confidentiality

Open disclosure consists of:

* An apology  
Without speculation, or apportioning blame, and including the words "I am sorry".
* A factual explanation of what happened
* An opportunity for the patient, family, and carers to relate to the experience
* A discussion of the potential consequences
* An explanation of the steps being taken to manage the adverse event


Current findings:

* Most effective as an ethical practice that prioritises individual and organisations learning from error, rather than solely as an operational risk management strategy
* Fosters cultures of openness and trust
* Patients prefer an open dialogue compared to didactic delivery of information
* Health professionals are supportive but concerns remain
	* Perceived medio-legal consequences
	* Preparedness required
	* Tensions between open and timely acknowledgement


## No Harm Incidents
In errors where no apparent harm has occurred, clinicians can only be certain by discussing the incident with the patient. Indiscriminate disclosure of near-misses and no-harm incidents is not feasible; and disclosure should be guided by:

* Will the distress or psychological harm of disclosing the error outweigh the benefit that could be obtained by the disclosure?
* Will disclosure reduce the risk of future incidents?
* Will disclosure maintain patient, family, and carer trust in the service?

# Rethinking resus

30 day survival where VT/VF is detected as
the first rhythm has been found to range between 41 -
58% [2], while other studies report a lower survival to
hospital discharge at 37% for both VT and VF [7].
Importantly 99.1% of IHCA presenting with VT or VF
retain a good neurological outcome [1]. It is frequently
found to have one of the highest success rates from
resuscitation, and has been found to respond the
most to addition of pressors compared to other
primary rhythms (22.6% without, 40.7% with, [3]).
Sustained ROSC >20 minutes has been shown to
occur for over 75% of VT/VF IHCAs [1].

In the event of IHCA complicated by PEA,
30 day survival ranges from 3.3 to 12.1% and there is
an inverse relationship between age and likelihood of
success [1,2]. Use of pressors improves likelihood of
survival (5.9% without to 15.2% with [3]).

Of 5606 patients with metastatic
or haematological malignancies who suffered IHCA,
only 1.1% (461) survived to hospital discharge [3].
Further meta-analysis demonstrated survival to
discharge of patients with metastatic disease
following IHCA was only 5.6% [4]. Of those with nonmetastatic
cancer, survival rates following IHCA are
slightly higher but still poor at 18 - 31% [5,6].

A common patient fear is that of losing cognitive
function following resuscitation. However, severe
What is not a common outcome of inhospital
cardiac arrest?
Chest wall trauma
Neurological injury
Subsequent cardiac arrest
Death
neurological deficits are uncommon following inhospital
cardiac arrests. Studies report cognitive
performance category scores (CPCs) of 1 or 2 (good
cerebral performance or moderate cerebral disability,
considered a “good” outcome) in 88- 97% of IHCAs
for all initial rhythms [1,2]. This is inclusive of those
elderly survivors with 88% of those > 90 years old
retaining a CPC of 1-2 [2].

Evidence suggests that the presenting rhythm is
shockable in 16.9 – 33.2% [1,2,3, 13] of IHCAs. Initial
shockable rhythm conferred an ↑ likelihood
of ROSC (RR 1.63) and 30-day survival (RR = 2.31) [13],
and nearly all of those resuscitated retain good
neurological function [13].

Indeed. The odds of 30 day survival following IHCA
due to respiratory insufficiency was found to be poor
at just 0.30, and when complicated by acute
pulmonary oedema was 0.18 [2]. Survival measures for
IHCA due to pulmonary embolism ranges from 24-
27%, while hypoxia ranges from 24-37% [8,9]. Overall
survival from respiratory causes has been found to
vary from to 24- 35.6% [5,8].

Aortic stenosis is a strong predictor of mortality and
unfavourable neurological outcome after in-hospital
cardiac arrest [10]. While 19% of patients with IHCA
and AS achieved sustained ROSC and survived until
hospital discharge, only 4.8% achieved a cerebral
performance category (CPC) of 1 or 2 reflecting a high
proportion of patients suffered cerebral deficit. Odds
of survival has been shown to be as poor as 0.14 [10].

In patients presenting with acute
myocardial infarction complicated by
tachyarrhythmias or sudden cardiac death, NSTEMI
patients were associated with higher long-term allcause
mortality compared with STEMI patients [11].
Furthermore, all-cause mortality at 2.5 years was
significantly higher for NSTEMI than STEMI patients 45% vs 34%) as was all-cause mortality at only 30
days (38% vs 28%) and in-hospital death (28% vs
37%) [11]. This is similarly reflected in the findings
that success of resuscitation for IHCA was poorer for
NSTEMI than STEMI with respect to 6 month survival
[8].

Preventing cardiac arrest and optimising
the patient’s condition should be the key strategy in
this case. Importantly, survival following resuscitation
for in-hospital cardiac arrest in patients with
metastatic cancer is typically poor at around 5% [3,4].
The likely etiological factor in this patient’s peri-arrest
is cardiac tamponade due to their lung cancer, and
this typically has a poor rate of survival following
resuscitation of around 7% [9]. Pericardiocentesis is
indicated in the peri-arrest situation as part of a
symptom focussed approach, but once the patient
has died pericardiocentesis as part of resuscitation is
not indicated. Once again the key factor in treatment
will be establishing shared goals of care with the patient’s and whanau. Meanwhile, cardiopulmonary
resuscitation in the form of chest compressions,
defibrillation, intubation and supplementary
medications are unlikely to provide a significant
likelihood of quality survival for this patient.

This patient has previously been
managing well independently, and prevention of
cardiac arrest will be crucial as cardiac arrest in this
context is likely to be non-reversible. Cardiac arrest
from pulmonary causes typically has a survival rate
ranging from 24-36.5% [5,8], and pneumonia alone
confers a survival to discharge of only 12.9% following
IHCA [5]. However, overall survival from IHCA is
significantly lessened by the presence of severe COPD
and other comorbid disease [12] and this should be a
sizeable consideration for this patient’s care.
Although it is not unreasonable to consider
restorative approach without attempting CPR,
fractured neck of femur and hospital acquired
pneumonia are both associated with reducing
functional status post discharge [15]. A shared goal of
care discussion should help elicit whether the
patients would consider restorative versus quality of
life goal of care.

Aortic stenosis is a strong predictor of
mortality and unfavourable neurological outcome
after in-hospital cardiac arrest [10]. Odds of survival
has been shown to be as poor as 0.14 [10], and as a
result cardiopulmonary resuscitation would not be
indicated. Therefore, both B and C are correct depending on the outcome of a shared goals of care
discussion with the patient inclusive of medical
treatment and diuresis, transcutaneous aortic valve
insertion or surgical aortic valve replacement.
Deciding the best approach requires a partnership
with the patient to determine their goal from
undertaking treatment and pair this with what is
medically appropriate.
