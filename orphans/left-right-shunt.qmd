# Left-to-Right Shunts


## Clinical Manifestations

Clinical appearance is due to the magnitude of:

* Increased right sided pressures and flow
	* Tachypnoea
	* Increased work of breathing
	* Tachycardia
* Decreased left sided flow  
Low-output state:
	* Increased capillary return
	* Mottled
	* Tachycardia


## Management

Physiological aims:

* B
	* High or high-normal PaCO<sub>2</sub>  
	Maintain PVR to increase systemic CO.
	* *Enough* FiO<sub>2</sub>  
	Aim SpO<sub>2</sub> ~93%.
	* PEEP  
	Optimise FRC. Usually ~7-8cmH<sub>2</sub>O.
		* May require recruitment maneuvres
