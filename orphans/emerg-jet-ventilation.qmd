# Transtracheal Jet Ventilation


*Insertion technique is covered under [needle cricothyrotomy](procedures/needle-cricothyrotomy.md)*

Transtracheal jet ventilation is the delivery of oxygen via a cannula placed in the cricothyroid or trachea. This technique:

* Can provide adequate oxygenation for over thirty minutes
* Is relatively safe in experienced hands

## Indications

* Rescue technique in CICO situation  
Intermediate technique prior to definitive surgical airway.
* Anticipated difficult airway
	* Provides additional safe apnoea time
	* *May* improve laryngoscopic view and tube passage by opening the glottis
* Laryngeal and oral surgery

## Contraindications

* Complete upper airway obstruction  
May lead to barotrauma.
* Foreign body  
Relative contraindication.
	* Foreign body may be expelled into the oropharynx, allowing it to be removed
	* May also lead to significant barotrauma  
	Lower flow rates (5-7L.min<sup>-1</sup> should be used with persistent obstruction).


## Physiology

* Oxygenation  
High oxygen tensions can rapidly be achieved.
* Pressure  
Peak airway pressure is a function of flow rate, inspiratory time, and degree of expiratory obstruction. In normal circumstances, peak airway pressures are limited as delivered gas is 'exhaled' via the pharynx.
* Ventilation  
Some ventilation is achieved, though typically respiratory acidosis occurs.

## Ventilation Technique

Jet ventilation:

* Provides oxygen via the tracheal route
* Exhalation occurs via the normal oral route
	* Airway obstruction may lead to high airway pressures and pneumothorax
	* Adequate expiratory time must be given  
	Exhalation occurs via the normal oral route, and so adequate time for exhalation must be provided.
	* Hand ventilation
	* High-frequency jet ventilation
* Can be performed using:
	* Hand ventilation  
	Intermittent ventilation: **1 second on, 4 seconds off**.
	* High-frequency jet ventilation

## Equipment

* Oxygen supply  
15L.min<sup>-1</sup> at 40-50psi
* Cannula  
	* 12-14G in adults
	* 16-18G in children
* Method for jet ventilation
	* Jet ventilation Y-piece
	* MacGuyver Technique  
	A 3-way stopcock can be connected to the cannula and oxygen tubing running at 15 L.min<sup>-1</sup>. Intermitently occluding the third port on the stop-cock facilitates ventilation.

## Complications

* Overall complication rate ~1% in centres with >100 cases/year
* Higher risk than supraglottic or subglottic jet-ventilation

* Pressure related:
	* Pneumothorax
	* Pneumomediastinum
	* Subcutaneous emphysema
	May be significant or minor.
		* May occur due to:
			* Catheter dislodgement
			* Use of high airway pressures
	* Cardiovascular instability  
	Impaired RV function due to decreased preload/increased afterload.
* Kinking of catheter
* Bleeding
* Infection
