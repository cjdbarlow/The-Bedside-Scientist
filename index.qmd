This is a collection of notes from my anaesthetic training and ANZCA Second Part exam, which is currently being expanded for the CICM Second Part exam.

Unlike [Part One](https://partone.litfl.com/), which is (or at least, was) "complete", this is still very much under construction. Many core topics are absent, others will be covered only partially and sometimes incorrectly, particularly if it is a topic I stumbled upon years ago and have not dusted off since.

References are light; though when present you can be confident I have read them. The bulk of the content is a systemisation of the things I've learned:

* At the bedside
* From wise clinician mentors
* From titans of critical care education, and from whom I have unrepentantly plagiarised, namely:
	* [Critical Care Compendium](https://litfl.com/ccc-critical-care-compendium/)
	* [The Internet Book of Critical Care](https://emcrit.org/ibcc/toc/)
	* [Deranged Physiology](https://derangedphysiology.com/main/home)
