# Evoked Potentials {#sec-ssep}

Evoked potentials are electrical signals generated in response to stimuli. They include:

* **Somatosensory**\
Electrical stimulation of the periphery with trace of the nerve impulse to the sensory cortex. SSEPs are:
	* Rapid
	* Portable
	* Non-invasive
	* Reported by:
		* Direction\
		A peak is given by a negative potential (N), a nadir by a positive potential (P).
		* *Expected* latency\
		How long (ms) between stimulation and detection.
* Motor\
Stimulation of the cortex with trace of impulse to a motor neuron or muscle group.
* Brainstem auditory

## Indications

Somatosensory potentials are used for:

* Neuroprognostication\
Indications:
	* After 24 hours  in:
		* Post cardiac arrest
		* TBI
	* With sedatives and analgesics
	* With hypothermia
	* With an abnormal EEG\
	No prognostic utility with normal EEG


## Contraindications

Somatosensory contraindications:

* Barbiturate coma
* Known or suspected lack of nerve integrity:
	* Peripheral nerve injury
	* Traumatic spinal cord injury


Motor evoked potential contraindications:

* Muscle relaxation

## Anatomy

## Equipment

## Technique

:::caution
Highly sensitive to electrical interference due to the very low (Î¼V) voltages detected.
:::

For neuroprognostication:

* Electrodes are placed to read activity at the:
	* Dorsal root ganglion (N9)\
	"Erb point".
	* Cervical spinal cord (N13)
	* Thalamus (P18)
	* Somatosensory cortex (**N20**)
* Median nerve stimulated at the level of the wrist
* Bilateral absence of N20 peaks is highly specific of poor neurological outcome after 24 hours
