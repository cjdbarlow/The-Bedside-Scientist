# Electroencephalogram {#sec-eeg}

:::info
This discusses EEG in the context of intensive care, predominantly in neuroprognostication.
:::

Electrical tracing of cerebral activity that consists of both:

* Background patterns
* Activity


## Background Patterns

Background activity is the most important prognostic feature, with progressive loss of background activity associated with increasingly poor prognosis. Key patterns include:

:::column-margin
Earlier achievement of a good EEG background is associated with better prognosis.
:::

* **Continuous background activity**\
Good prognostic sign.
* **Discontinuous background activity**\
Alternating continuous activity with suppression 10-40% of the time.
* **Burst suppression**\
Long periods of electrographic silence with short bursts of activity.
	* Specific of very poor prognosis if exclusion of other causes:
		* Sedatives
		* Analgesics
		* Status epilepticus
		* Encephalopathy
		* Anoxic brain injury
		* Hypothermia
	* Epileptiform or identical bursts are associated with poor prognosis
* **Suppression**\
Electrical silence >99% of the time. Due to:
	* Profound brain injury
	* Severe hypothermia
	* Deep anaesthesia
	* Acute hypoperfusion


## Activity

Additional findings:

* **Periodic discharge**\
Repeating waveform at a set interval. Divided into:
	* Generalised Periodic Discharges on suppressed background\
	Poor prognosis, and consistent with status myoclonus if clinical myoclonus present.
	* Periodic discharges on a continuous background\
	Non-specific. May respond to antiepileptics.
* **Sporadic epileptiform discharges**\
Repeating waveform at no regular interval. Generally poor prognosis.
* **Seizure**\
Highly specific for poor outcome after cardiac arrest.
* **Status epilepticus**\
Poor prognostic sign.


* Hypoxic encephalopathy
	* Theta activity
	* Diffuse slowing
	* Burst suppression
	* Alpha coma

### Other Findings

Findings associated with other disease include:

* Paroxysmal triphasic waves\
Hepatic encephalopathy.
* Periodic sharp spikes\
Herpes encephalitis.
