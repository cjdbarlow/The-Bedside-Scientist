# Atrial Electrocardiogram

Single-lead ECG performed at the bedside and used to characterise the nature of a tachyarrhythmia when:

* Presence or nature of atrial activity is uncertain
* Atrial epicardial wires are present
* The patient is not dependent on atrial pacing


## Equipment

## Technique

There are two described techniques, the exact method will vary depending on what equipment is available:

:::

1. Attach one atrial wire to the V~1~ terminal, and monitor lead V~1~
2. Attach both atrial wires to the LA and RA terminal, and monitor lead I


## Interpretation

Direct measurement of atrial electrical activity results in a significant increase in amplitude of any atrial activity, such that **the largest deflections in the monitored lead will be atrial**, assuming atrial activity is present.
