# Transfusion Serology

Immunohaematology and red cell serological tests are used to identify safe products for transfusion. These tests include:

* Saline agglutination
* Antiglobulin (Coombs) testing
	* Direct
	* Indirect

## Saline Agglutination

* Sample of donor product and recipient cells are mixed in a saline suspension
* Agglutination indicates ABO incompatibility


## Antiglobulin Testing

Antiglobulin testing consists of either:

* Direct Antiglobulin Testing\
**Antiglobulin** present **on surface** of patient **erythrocytes**. Positive in:
	* Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia
	* Haemolytic transfusion reactions
* Indirect Antiglobulin Testing\
**Antibody** (usually IgG) present **in plasma**. Predominantly used in transfusion for:
	* Minor antibody detection
	* Pre-transfusion compatibility
