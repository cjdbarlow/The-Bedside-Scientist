# Haemostatic Assays

Coagulation testing can be divided into tests of:

* **Primary haemostasis**\
Formation of the initial platelet plug.
* **Secondary haemostasis**\
Fibrin generation via the coagulation cascade.
* **Global Coagulation**\
Holistic test of entire coagulation system function.

## Primary Haemostasis

Defects of platelet plug formation can be due to either:

* **Quantitative**\
Loss in absolute platelet number. Causes include:
	* Consumption
		* DIC
	* Bone marrow suppression
		* Medications
		* Sepsis
* **Qualitative**\
Adequate platelet number but impaired function. Causes include:
	* Drugs
		* Aspirin
		* Clopidogrel
		* Ticagrelor
	* Uraemia
	* Hepatic cirrhosis
	* Extracorporeal circuits
		* CPB
		* ECMO
	* Bone marrow dysfunction
		* Multiple myeloma
		* Myeloproliferative disorders


### Platelet Count

Revealed by platelet count on an FBE:

* <50×10^9^/L is significant in the presence of haemostatic failure


### Platelet Function

Platelet function assays provide a qualitative assessment of platelet function, and are used for:

* Diagnosis of platelet disorders
* Monitor effect of antiplatelet therapy\
Quantify response to GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors or clopidogrel.


## Secondary Haemostasis

Assessment includes:

* Coagulation assays
	* PT
	* APTT
	* TCT
	* Mixing studies
	* Fibrinogen
* Fibrinolytic assays
	* D-Dimer


### Prothrombin Time

Time taken for blood to clot after addition of tissue factor. The PT is:

* A test of the **extrinsic pathway**
* Prolonged by:
	* Factor VII deficiency
	* Liver disease
	* Vitamin K deficiency
	* Oral Xa inhibitors
* Used to calculate an **INR**\
Normalises the PT calculation between laboratories so they can be accurately compared.


### Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time

:::info
Also known as the Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT), or historically as the kaolin-cephalin clotting time (KCCT).
:::

Time taken for blood to clot after addition of some reagent. The APTT is:

* A test of the **intrinsic pathway**
* Highly variable between laboratories\
Normal ranges (including for anticoagulation with heparin) are variable.
* Prolonged by:
	* Factor VIII, IX, or XI deficiency
	* Contact phase deficiency\
	Does not result in clinically significant bleeding. Due to deficiency in:
		* Factor XII
		* Prekallikrein
	* Oral thrombin inhibitors

:::column-margin
Prolongation of both the PT and APTT may be due to deficiency of:

* Factor X or V
* Prothrombin (Factor II)
* Fibrinogen (Factor I)
:::


### Thrombin Clotting Time

:::info
Also known as Thrombin Time (TT).
:::

Time taken for blood to clot after thrombin has been added. The TT is:

* A test of fibrinogen to fibrin conversion
* Prolonged by:
	* ↓ Fibrinogen
	* Dysfibrinogenaemia
	* Heparin
	* Presence of FDP

### Reptilase Time

Time taken for blood to clot after addition of reptilase, which is:

:::column-margin
Reptilase is also known as batroxobin, and is a haemolytic snake venom harvested from some aggressive species of the *Bothrops* genus of South American pit viper.
:::

* Used as an adjunct to identify the cause of an ↑ TCT
* Normal with:
	* Heparin
	* Hirudin
	* Direct thrombin inhibitor
* Prolonged by:
	* Dysfibrinogenaemia
	* Presence of FDP


### Mixing Studies

Mixing studies involve combining equal parts normal donor plasma and patient plasma. Mixing studies:

* Can be performed for PT, APTT, and TCT
* Will **correct** if the coagulation abnormality is due to **factor deficiency**
* Will **not correct** if the abnormality is due to a **factor inhibitor**
	* Direct thrombin inhibitors
		* Heparin
		* Dabigatran
	* Acquired Factor VIII inhibitor\
	Acquired haemophilia A.
	* Lupus anticoagulant
		* Antiphospholipid syndrome

:::column-margin
How much correction is required for result to be "corrected" is controversial:

* Large or multiple factor deficiencies may not correct with mixing
* Many patients have both deficiencies and inhibitors
* Some inhibitors are time-dependent
* Suggested indicators for adequate correction include the correct result:
	* Entering the normal range
	* Falling below some laboratory standardised value\
	Change of >70% is usually considered a correction.

:::

### Fibrinogen

Fibrinogen is:

* ↑ In:
	* Acute phase reactions
* ↓ In:
	* Consumptive coagulopathy
	* Hyperfibrinolysis


### D-Dimer

The D-dimer is a measurement of FDP produced by fibrinolysis produced by the action of plasmin, and is ↑ with:

* Thromboembolism
* Post-operative
* Trauma
* AKI
* Sepsis
* DIC with hyperfibrinolysis


## Global Coagulation Assays

Global assays include:

* Thromboelastography
* Thrombin Generation Tests


### Thromboelastography

Thromboelastographic methods graph the changing strength and elasticity of a forming blood clot over time. These methods:

:::column-margin
Due to the strong evidence supporting use of antifibrinolytics such as TXA in bleeding without strong evidence of harm, the utility of early detection of fibrinolysis is questionable since empiric treatment is safe.
:::

* Include:
	* TEG\
	Cup spins and pin remains stationary.
	* ROTEM\
	Pin rotates and cup remains stationary.
* May have different additives to:
	* Specifically test different aspects of clot formation\
	e.g. A heparinase channel, to estimate what clot strength would be in absence of heparin.
	* Speed up test formation
* Advantages
	* Real-time testing\
	Can be analysed as it progresses, rather than waiting for testing to be completed.
	* Guide use of blood product including platelets, FFP, factor concentrates, and cryoprecipitate
	* Give an **early** signal of the **presence** of **fibrinolysis**\
	Otherwise no strong evidence of benefit over traditional haemostatic testing.
* Disadvantages
	* Additional training required to perform and interpret
	* More expensive than traditional testing\
	Cost arguments are made that it saves excessive blood product use.
	* Results do not translate directly to standard coag assays which are used in most guidelines for monitoring treatment
	* Unclear what values should be targeted
* Measure various parameters including:
	* **R** (Reaction) **time** (Clotting Time)\
	Time until initial fibrin formation.
		* Efficacy of clotting cascade\
		* Prolonged R time indicates:
			* Clotting factor deficiency
				* Warfarin
			* Direct thrombin inhibition
			* Heparin
		* Prolonged R time treated with:
			* Factor replacement
			* Reversal of anticoagulant
	* **K** (Kinetic) **time**/**α-angle** (Clot Formation Time)\
	Both index the time taken to achieve a certain level of clot strength.
		* Prolonged K time indicates:
			* Inadequate platelets
				* Quantitative\
				Thrombocytopaenia.
				* Qualitative\
				Platelet dysfunction.
			* ↓ Fibrinogen
			* Severe factor deficiency\
			Will also ↑ R time.
		* ↓ α-angle or ↑ K time are treated with:
			* Cryoprecipitate
			* Platelets
	* **Maximum Amplitude** (Maximum Clot Firmness)\
	Strength of platelet-fibrin interaction.
		* ↓ MA indicates inadequate platelet function
		* Treatment with:
			* Platelets
			* DDAVP\
			If qualitative defect.
	* **Lysis time**
		* Time taken until clot degrades by a certain percentage (e.g. LY30)
		* Short lysis time treated with antifibrinolytics
