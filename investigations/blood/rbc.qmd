# Erythrocytes {#sec-rbc}

Red cell indices reported on a full blood exam may include:

:::column-margin
Red cell indices essentially describe:

* How much haemoglobin there is
* How many cells the haemoglobin is distributed into
:::

* **Haemoglobin**\
Concentration of haemoglobin in blood.
	* Indicator of oxygen carrying capacity
* **Haematocrit**\
Proportion of blood volume made up of erythrocytes.
	* Usually ~3x the haemoglobin
* **Red cell count**\
Number of cells per microlitre.
* **MCV**\
Average volume of individual erythrocytes.
	* Classifies anaemia into microcytic, macrocytic, or normocytic
* **MCH**\
Average amount of haemoglobin per erythrocyte.
* **MCHC**\
Average concentration of haemoglobin in red cells.
* **Red cell histogram**\
Graphical display of variation in erythrocyte volume.
* **RDW**\
Measure of *variation* in erythrocyte volume, calculated from the width of the histogram at 1 SD from the mean, divided by the MCV.

## Abnormalities

Abnormal findings include:

:::column-margin
Some abnormal findings are specific to blood smears, others are detected on automated analysers.
:::

:::column-margin
Splenic macrophages remove damaged and abnormal erythrocytes from circulation; asplenic patients may therefore accumulate a significant number of the more abnormal forms that are produced in small numbers in health.
:::

* **Macrocytosis** (Normal: 80-10 fL)\
Enlarged erythrocytes, occurring usually due to abnormal development or membrane composition. Causes are divided into:
	* Common:
		* Vitamin B~12~ deficiency
		* Folate deficiency
		* Alcoholism
		* Myelodysplasia
	* Uncommon
		* Reticulocytosis
		* Liver disease
		* Hypothyroidism
		* Multiple myeloma
		* Aplastic anaemia
		* Leukaemia
		* Drugs

:::

* **Dimorphic population**\
Bimodal distribution of erythrocyte cell volume on a red cell histogram. Usually occurs due to:
	* Normocytic normochromic cells that existed either prior to disease onset or after treatment
	* Microcytic hypochromic cells that existed either prior to (e.g., iron infusion) or after (e.g. myeloablation) treatment

:::column-margin
![RBC Histogram: Post-Iron Infusion](/resources/rbc_histo_post_iron.png)
:::

* **Sickle Cell**\
Erythrocyte deformed by HbS which has polymerised under hypoxic stress. Diagnostic of sickle cell disease.

:::column-margin
![Sickle Cell](/resources/sickle.jpg)
:::

:::column-margin
Sickle cell disease is covered under @sec-hbs. 
:::

* **Reticulocytosis** (Normal: 0.5-2.5%)\
Juvenile erythrocytes that contain RNA remnants and ribosomes but no nucleus, ejected into circulation in response to anaemia.

:::column-margin
![Reticulocytosis](/resources/retic.png)
:::

* **Schistocytes**\
Fragmented, irregular, jagged erythrocytes formed by mechanical destruction during haemolysis. 

:::column-margin
![Schistocytes](/resources/schistocyte.jpg)
:::

* **Nucleated erythrocytes** (Normoblastaemia)\
Circulating erythrocyte precursors that have yet to eject their nucleus, indicating either:
	* ↓ DO~2~\
	Release of immature red cells to try and add some additional oxygen carrying capacity. Causes include:
		* Hypoxaemia
		* Anaemia\
		Any cause.
	* Hyposplenism\
	Normoblasts are normally removed in the spleen.
		* Hyposplenism
		* Malaria
		* Sickle cell anaemia
		* Physiologic\
		3-10 normoblasts per 100 WBC are normal at birth.
	* Bone marrow stress\
	Upregulation of bone-marrow production, overwhelming capacity of spleen for elimination.
		* Bone marrow destruction
			* Haematological malignancy
			* Bony metastases
			* Histiocytosis
			* Sarcoidosis
		* Extramedullary haematopoiesis
			* Chronic haemolysis
			* Polycythaemia vera
	* Multifactorial
		* Sepsis
		* Uraemia
		* Liver disease
		* DKA
		* IBD
		* Burns
		* Chemotherapy

{{< include /includes/hyperviscosity.qmd >}}
:::

* **Rouleaux Formations**\
Reversible agglutination of erythrocyte in a stack or coin-like formation, which may occur due to:
	* ↑ Plasma protein (but not albumin)
		* Multiple myeloma
	* Inflammation
		* Malignancy
		* Infection
		* Inflammation
	* ↑ Blood viscosity
		* Hyperviscosity syndromes
		* Dehydration

:::column-margin
![Rouleaux Formation](/resources/rouleaux.jpg)
:::

* **Target Cells**\
Erythrocyte with a disproportionate amount of membrane to haemoglobin, and is:
	* Common in:
		* Thalassaemia
		* Jaundice
		* Post-splenectomy
	* Uncommon in:
		* Sickle cell anaemia
		* Iron deficiency

:::column-margin
![Target Cells](/resources/target.jpg)
:::

* **Spherocytosis**\
Erythrocyte with a disproportionate amount of haemoglobin to membrane, resulting in distortion of the biconcave disk to a spherical shape with a greater volume-to-surface area ratio. Causes include:
	* Haemolytic anaemias
	* Hereditary spherocytosis

:::column-margin
![Spherocytosis](/resources/spherocytosis.jpg)
:::

* **Howell-Jolly Bodies**\
Erythrocyte containing DNA remnants, which occur with:
	* Post-splenectomy
	* Haemolysis
	* Megaloblastic anaemia
	* Macrocytosis

* **Heinz Bodies** (Heinz-Ehrlich bodies)\
Erythrocyte containing denatured haemoglobin, indicating oxidative stress due to:
	* Toxins
		* Quinidine
		* Primaquine
	* Unstable haemoglobin form
		* α-thalassaemia
		* Methaemoglobinaemia
	* Damaged RBC metabolism
		* G6PD
		* Bactrim toxicity
